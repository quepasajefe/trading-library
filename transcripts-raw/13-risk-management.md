# Risk Management - 2025 Model Series Lecture 13

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. During this lecture, I will be discussing risk management with you.

Technicals make you fall in love with the game. Risk management keeps you in the game.

Now the reason why I would like to begin this lecture with this statement in front of you is due to the following. Many of you probably got introduced to the world of trading with concepts such as supply and demand, or you might have gone down the indicator path where you were trading based upon mathematical systems or whatever it might have been that you were using in the beginning of your trading career.

And even with the strategies which I'm teaching to you within my mentorship, I would like you to understand that all these technical things that get you into a trade are all only working in the long run with proper risk management. And therefore risk management is crucial. And therefore during this lecture, I want to put emphasis on three different strategies which you can look into when it comes to risk management.

## Regular Risk Management

Now, first of all, I would like to pay attention with you to what I define as regular risk management. This form of risk management is used by the majority of traders and it's in my opinion also the most easy way of managing risk. And the reason why this is the case is because when it comes to this form of risk management, there aren't a lot of moving parts.

So what I would like to show is that when it comes to regular risk management, the first trade is always going to be 1% risk. Now, by the way, it's important to note that when it comes to all of the percentages which I will be discussing during this lecture, they can be basically changed to whatever you are comfortable with, as long as what you do after a win and loss in terms of what to do for the next position in terms of percentage risk stays the same.

So meaning what you will see is that within regular risk management, what we do is after a loss gets taken, the risk on the next trade gets decreased by half. So if you're risking for the beginning trade, let's say 0.5% risk on the next position, it will be 0.25% risk. But what you can see is that when it comes to this example right here, where we're using 1% risk in the beginning and we take a win, what we will do is we're going to maintain the same risk, meaning on the next position, we're going to maintain 1% risk.

If we ever take a loss and we have an idea which doesn't pan out as we had anticipated it to, we're going to decrease our risk to 0.5% risk on the next trade until the drawdown is recovered. So what you can see is that we're halving the risk on the next position. The reason why we're halving the risk on the next position is due to the fact that that way we're able to maintain our equity curve as smooth as possible.

Let's say that the second trade is also a loss. If the second trade is also a loss, we're going to stick to 0.5% risk until the drawdown is recovered. So what you can see is that our job is to try and smoothen our equity curve by making sure that we do not have deep drawdowns.

If the next trade, however, turns out to be a winner, we're going to go back to 1% risk on the next position and the same cycle repeats itself, where we're going to begin with 1% risk and move from there on.

Now, what I would suggest you to do is I would suggest you to take screenshots of all the different risk management strategies which I'm outlining to you during this lecture, and I would like you to think about which one suits you best. And that's the risk management strategy which I would suggest you to investigate.

It's important to note that I'm not telling you to use these risk management strategies. I'm only sharing with you my personal suggestions when it comes to these types of risk management strategies and trading.

### Hypothetical Example of Regular Risk Management

Let us take a look at the hypothetical example of applying regular risk management. Here you can see a sequence of trades and we're going to be walking through the sequence of trades. What you can see is that this trader applies a fixed one to three risk to reward. And I personally do not believe in fixed risk to rewards. I believe that risk to reward should be dynamic, meaning it should change trade by trade. However, some people use fixed risk to reward. And for the sake of me showing to you the power of regular risk management, we're going to be using that.

So what you can see is that at the first trade, the beginning equity is 100,000 dollars. The risk on this trade is going to be 1%. The outcome of this trade is that it's a loser. Therefore, the result of this trade is approximately minus a thousand dollars.

For the second trade then, what we can see is that the equity is 99,000 dollars. The risk on this second trade, however, is going to be 0.5%. And the reason why is because we're sizing down the amount of risk relative to the first trade which was a loser. What you can see is that the outcome of this trade was a winner and therefore the result is approximately one and a half thousand dollars in profit.

This means that for trade three, we're back above the beginning equity of 100,000 dollars. We're going to be risking 1% again. And what I would like to show is that this trade turns out to be a winner and the result therefore is 3000 dollars in profit.

This means that for the fourth trade, the beginning equity is going to be 103 and a half thousand dollars. And as you can see, the risk on this position is going to be 1% once again. So what you can see is that this is a very simple way of applying regular risk management where the risk maintains 1% unless the trader gets into drawdown, because then the risk gets decreased until the drawdown is basically recovered with interest. And therefore what this does is that it makes sure that no deep spirals take place within the equity curve.

And this is a simple way of applying risk management and this repeats itself until the profit objectives have been met. However, when it comes to this style of risk management, the focus has to be on what's occurring right here, where you can see that by trade two, the risk gets halved. And the reason why this is so important is because whenever this trader enters into drawdown, he immediately decreases his position size. So he makes sure that he doesn't lose a lot during a losing cycle.

And therefore what's occurring is that the moment that he gets back into profit with this one and a half K of profit and he gets back above that 100,000 dollars beginning equity, what it allows for is that it allows him to go back to the original risk. So the focus has to be on sizing down during a period in which losses are being taken. And notice that with this strategy, no sizing up takes place, meaning the risk maintains 1%.

## Prop Firm Risk Management

When it comes to prop firm risk management, however, I would like to discuss a different approach. And this is the approach which I would suggest to look into during challenge phases. I'm not telling you to go out there and go into prop firms because I believe that prop firms actually are a bad way of getting into trading. And the reason why is because they are made for you to lose. The prop firms profit from you failing. And therefore there are all these types of different rules in play, which are basically trying to make trading harder than it needs to be. And therefore it basically cultivates a very bad mindset for a lot of traders.

However, if you would like to go down the prop firm route, then this is a style of risk management which you can look into. There are two different stages when it comes to approaching prop firms. First one is a challenge phase in which you're basically proving to the prop firm that you can trade consistently profitable. And secondly, there's the live trading phase. During these phases, I suggest utilizing different risk approaches.

### Challenge Phase Risk Management

And the reason why is because throughout the challenge phase, you would like to be more aggressive and that means that risk stays the same. Where during the previous risk management strategy, we decreased the risk when we went into drawdown. For this phase, we're going to maintain the same level of risk. And the reason why is because we do not want to spend too much time within the challenges since there's no return on it, meaning there's no money to be made from the challenges.

Therefore within a challenge, what I suggest to look into is applying 20% of the total allowed drawdown in a challenge. So let's say that you're allowed to lose a maximum of 3,000 dollars on a 100,000 dollar account. What it means is that you would divide that number that you are allowed to lose by five and that's how you get 20%. And that is the risk which I would suggest utilizing during the challenge phase.

And the reason why is because that way you're not going to be spending too much time within the challenge, because that's an issue traders face where they go to these prop firms, they go to these challenges and they stay in those challenges for a long period of time. Eventually they get funded and they think they have made it, but they realize that there is no money that gets made the moment that you pass a challenge. And therefore you wasted all this time whilst in reality you should be more aggressive throughout the challenge phases.

### Funded Account Risk Management

Now when it comes to managing risk once funded on the prop firm, I would suggest the following approach to risk management, where the main focus should be on being conservative. This means that risk is going to change. And the reason why risk is going to change is because throughout bad periods we need to make sure that the drawdown stays at the minimum. So this comes very close to the risk management approach which we saw for the regular risk management.

What I would suggest looking into is using 10% of the total allowed drawdown once funded as the initial risk. If there's a win which gets taken, the risk remains equal unless you have a big buffer, but we'll get into an approach to increase the risk in a bit. However, as a general rule of thumb, risk remains equal regardless of whether you're winning.

However, when you take a loss, I would suggest looking into halving the risk, meaning only using 5% of the total allowed drawdown until the drawdown which you're in gets recovered. So this approach comes very close to the regular risk management approach. However, please keep in mind that this is kind of different than the regular risk management approach because we're not using 1% of the total equity. Now we're using a percentage as our basically risk based upon the amount of drawdown which we're allowed to have.

And the reason why is due to the following. Why regular risk management does not work on prop firms? 1% risk of a 100K funded account equals 1000 dollars. If your total max drawdown is 3000 dollars, it means that you are risking one third of your max drawdown, meaning in three trades you could lose your funded account. Do you understand that that's way too quick? And therefore you cannot use simply the regular risk management as I've shown to you prior on prop firms.

Now if you're trading your own capital, it's a different story. However, when it comes to trading prop firms, you need to make sure that you're very conservative. And the way that you become conservative once trading a funded live account is by making sure that the percentage which you use as risk on every trade is a percentage based upon the amount of risk which you can have, meaning the total allowed drawdown. Not simply based upon equity size, because that stuff doesn't work with prop firms as you can see right in front of you.

## Exponential Risk Management

Now we're going to be looking at the third form of risk management and this third form of risk management is called exponential risk management. And exponential risk management is a method of increasing accounts at a very rapid pace. However, this is a form of risk management which is not suggested for new traders. And the reason why is because when it comes to exponential risk management, first of all you need to know exactly what you're doing, meaning you need to know exactly what you look for and when you look for it in the markets.

Secondly, what you must be able to do is you must be able to distance yourself from the fact that you just made money, because on the next position you're going to be risking a lot of that money which you just made. And that's something which we're going to get into.

But when it comes to exponential risk management, what I would like to show is that we begin once again with one percent risk. And the reason why we begin with one percent risk is that for the sake of doing these calculations with you, it's just an easy number to work with.

Whenever we take a loss on this first trade, what we do is we apply regular risk management where we decrease the amount of risk on the next position until the drawdown is recovered. If we lose again on trade two, we're going to stick to zero point five percent risk until the drawdown is recovered. Let's say however that we take a win—we're going to go back to one percent risk and the cycle starts again, so to say.

### The Power of Win Streaks

The power of exponential risk management occurs when you go on a win streak. And the reason why is due to the following. If you take a win on your first trade, on the second trade what you can look into doing is risking fifty percent of the trade's profits. So think about that. Let's say that your initial risk was a thousand dollars and you just made five thousand dollars. What exponential risk management suggests is that on the second trade you're going to be risking fifty percent—or maybe even a hundred percent, but I would look into using fifty percent—using fifty percent of the profits which you just made on trade number two as risk, meaning you're going to be looking to risk two and a half thousand dollars on the next position.

If you then take a winner with the same risk to reward, so one to five, you can see how the profits begin to increase very significantly within a short period of time. If you take a loss however on the second trade, you're going to go back to one percent risk. So the cycle begins again at step number one.

Let's say that you win again on trade number three. That is where twenty five percent of the profits of trade number two will be risked, and if this trade turns into a loser or a winner, we're going to go back to step number one which is risking one percent.

So what you can see is that whenever you go on a win streak and you're applying exponential risk management, this can really make your equity curve quickly grow. However, you must understand that in order for you to go on a win streak in the first place, you must be able to know exactly what you're looking for and when you look for it. And therefore this is a style of risk management which is in my opinion not suited for the majority of new traders. And this is a style of risk management which is very aggressive and it requires capital, meaning if you do not have a lot of capital yet, I suggest you to be cautious when it comes to trying out exponential risk management.

I understand that you might be looking at this and you might be thinking to yourself, "Hey, I'm able to make a lot of money when I'm on a win streak by just risking the profits which I just made." Yes, that's true. However, it's going to be a mental burden for you if the risk which you're using on this position is too big. So therefore be mindful of that.

### Exponential Risk with Prop Firms

However, let's say that you're trading with prop firms and let's say that you're trading a live account with a prop firm. First of all, 1% risk of the total equity is not possible like we have seen prior. However, let's say that you're simply working with for example a regular amount of risk, so 10% of your max allowed drawdown. Let's say that you have a max allowed drawdown of—let's go back to 3,000 dollars—so let's say 3,000 dollars. That means that you're risking 300 dollars and that is basically the risk for that first trade.

Let's say that that first trade turns out to be a winner and you make 1,500 dollars on that trade, 1 to 5. For the next trade what you can look into doing then is risking 750 dollars, which is 50% of your profit. And if this trade turns out to be a winner as well, what will happen then is the following. What will happen is that you're going to be making 5 times 750. Think about that. Whilst your initial risk was only 300 dollars. So do you see where exponential risk management can come in handy when you're trying to grow your equity curve in a very quick manner?

But again, please keep in mind that when it comes to trading prop firms and such, there are a lot of rules and I'm not familiar with the rules—they have changed I'm sure since I've last traded at them, which is a few years ago. So I know not all of the little things that are present right now. But based upon what I'm hearing sometimes from students when it comes to emails or support messages etc., I know that you're limited a lot. And therefore be cautious when trying out exponential risk management. And therefore this is an approach which is in my opinion mainly suitable for personal accounts, and that is something for the people that are trading personal accounts to potentially consider.

## Core Principle: Decrease Risk in Drawdown

Now with that being said, I've shown to you three different risk management strategies. But do you see how each different risk management strategy comes back to decreasing risk when in drawdown? And the reason why I'm putting so much emphasis on decreasing risk when in drawdown is due to the fact that that makes sure that your equity doesn't take deep dives. But it also shows to you that you're able to maintain a sense of discipline where you're able to say, "Hey, you know what, I do not need to regain this lost equity right away."

Now if you would like to use exponential risk management, again be cautious because it takes a lot of experience and you need to have a thick skin within your mind because you must be able to handle bigger numbers fluctuating. That takes time, guys. You don't immediately go to trading multiple minis when you just start out with trading—simply doesn't happen.

Therefore that's why we always suggest: begin with micros. And once you are comfortable with micros, you can consider on your own—I will never tell you to go out here and trade live money—however, if you decide on your own that you're ready to trade minis, that's when you consider trading minis as well.

## Conclusion

I hope that this lecture has provided you with a good insight on different risk management strategies which I personally use—except the prop firm ones of course—and I hope that you have gotten a great deal of insight on when it comes to navigating risk management accordingly.

I want to thank you for watching this lecture all the way to the end. After this lecture we're going to be diving into different delivery profiles for the different sessions from London all the way to New York PM, and I will be sharing with you specific algorithmic signatures to look for during the sessions.

I look forward to speaking to you in the next one. Be safe.
