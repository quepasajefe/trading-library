# Higher Time Frame Institutional Order Flow - 2025 Model Series Lecture 04

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on higher time frame institutional order flow.

## The Importance of Higher Time Frame Analysis

Before we dive into the lecture, I first want to share the following quote with you:

**"If you cannot anticipate the move taking place based upon the higher time frame charts, you have no purpose dropping into lower time frame charts."**

The reason why is because if you zoom into the lower time frame charts too quickly, you are likely going to get lost in the price action. Therefore, it's crucial that you learn to establish a higher time frame narrative first of all. And that's what we will discuss during this lecture.

## Defining Institutional Order Flow

First of all, we will discuss what institutional order flow is.

**Bullish Institutional Order Flow** is present when price is expanding higher, retracing lower, and expanding higher. Premium arrays will get violated and discount arrays will get created which will function as support on price.

**Bearish Institutional Order Flow** is present when price is expanding lower, retracing higher, and expanding lower. Discount arrays will get violated and premium arrays will get created which will function as resistance on price.

These are the two definitions of both bullish and bearish institutional order flow. We also have neutral institutional order flow, but that is basically when there's no one-sided order flow present, and that is when you anticipate consolidation taking place. Throughout this lecture however, we are going to focus purely on bullish and bearish institutional order flow.

## Bullish Institutional Order Flow

Let's first take a look at bullish institutional order flow.

Bullish institutional order flow is present when the market moves from point A, which is on the bottom left right here, to point B, which is on the top right. This is the schematic which I introduced to you throughout the price cycle lecture of this Models series. This is the schematic which we're going to work with moving forward. Keep this schematic in mind.

What we can see right here is that I've created price action and I've annotated two lines. I've annotated a red line on the lower end which represents a point of interest, and I annotated a green line on the top right here which represents a draw on liquidity.

Right in front of you, you can see a visual representation of the market maker buy model. The market maker buy model takes place in markets which are trending higher, which are being repriced towards the upside, meaning there's bullish institutional order flow which is present.

### The Pattern of Bullish Markets

What you will see in bullish markets is the following: What you will see is that the market will begin to consolidate, and this consolidation right here has one function. That function is to engineer buy-side liquidity above these relative equal highs. Retail-minded traders will look at these highs as a strong resistance area having been reached.

When the market then expands towards the downside, it confirms their existing idea of a strong resistance area being met. They see the market expand towards the downside, and we see it retrace higher to continue expanding lower. This continues until we reach the point of interest right here.

Meaning, you can see that we were in a sell program from this area all the way to the point of interest. The price swing which was taking place was A to B. Eventually the point of interest gets met, and what we can see is that point B turns into our new point A, and the next price swing which will occur is from point A right here to point B.

If you do not understand what I mean by the use of the language of point A and point B, I highly suggest you to go back to the price cycles lecture.

### Recognizing the Change from Bearish to Bullish

What you can see is that the market reprices lower into the point of interest, and we see the market begin to show the signs of forming a reversal in this area. Now what I will outline to you throughout this lecture is specifically how we can recognize that the order flow is changing from bearish to bullish.

When we pay attention to the following schematic, then what you can see is that I've outlined two blue shaded areas right here. What these blue shaded areas represent are imbalances which formed throughout this repricing towards the downside.

Now what I want you to pay attention to is first of all the following imbalance right here. This imbalance in particular is very important to monitor because this imbalance formed throughout the final price swing which reached our point of interest—meaning it reached the area where we anticipate a buy program to unfold off of.

Therefore, what we will be monitoring is the following: What we will be monitoring is the reaction to this imbalance. If we would begin to see the market displace above this imbalance and utilize it as support on price, from that moment in time we can confidently say that order flow has changed from bearish to bullish.

Pay attention to the imbalance which formed throughout this final leg towards the downside—that's a key insight which I want you to write down.

### The Zeussy Market Structure Shift Pattern

Now what you can see then is that the market reprices into the next imbalance which formed right here. Notice that we initially reject this imbalance and we retrace. This right here is very important to note, and the reason why is because of the fact that the market is retracing into this old high right here.

What I want you to understand is that the fact that this premium array in the form of an FVG failed to function as resistance on price is the first sign to you that order flow is changing from bearish to bullish.

Next, what you're seeing is that the market is trading above an up-close candle which will have formed throughout this swing high formation in this area. The fact that this up-close candle did not function as resistance on price shows to you that the underlying order flow is changing from bearish to bullish, because what you can see right here is that inside of this high formation you will see a bullish breaker form.

Why is this a bullish breaker? Well, what you can see is that the market expanded lower and we formed this low right in advance of the point of interest. Notice that a retracement higher took place, and the market then expanded towards the downside once more, taking out the sell-side liquidity engineered below this low. Notice that this high also set up the final run into a point of interest.

The moment that the market displaces above this high, we anticipate that the final up-close candle which will have formed in this area will function as support on price because this up-close candle is your bullish breaker.

Notice that you can see that I've annotated this lightbulb emoji. The reason why I've annotated this lightbulb emoji is because what you can see is that this high right here formed inside of an FVG on the left side of the curve—a bearish fair value gap. Notice that the market retraced into that and then expanded lower. We then saw the market displace above this high with an imbalance.

**This right here is what I refer to as the Zeussy market structure shift pattern.** This market structure shift pattern is present within a lot of the market reversals which you will see. If it's not present on the timeframe through which you are looking at the markets, I highly suggest you to drop into the lower timeframes and investigate whether or not it's there.

### The Fractal Nature of Order Flow

What we can see is that the market retraces into that bullish breaker—that red shaded box. It retraces into this bullish fair value gap, and notice that the market finds support there before expanding higher.

Isn't that interesting to think about? How did I define bullish institutional order flow to you? I outlined to you that when the market expands towards the upside, retraces lower, and then continues its expansion higher, that right there is bullish institutional order flow.

On the lower timeframes, what you will see is the following delivery taking place: Meaning, inside of this retracement lower followed by expansion higher, you will see this schematic right here on the lower timeframes—meaning you will see a lower time frame market maker buy model. The same applies to the next expansion followed by retracement followed by another expansion, and the next and the next, guys.

I want you to put this in your mind and I want you to investigate this because I'm telling you right now during this lecture, this has been hidden underneath your nose all this time. Because the point of interest right here which I've showcased by this red line could be, for example, this bullish breaker's range. And what could the draw on liquidity be? The draw on liquidity could be this high or a level above.

Are you beginning to see how everything is fractal? Simply by me explaining these schematics to you.

## Bearish Institutional Order Flow

Let's now take a look at the bearish side of things. Let's take a look at bearish institutional order flow.

For bearish institutional order flow, what you can see is that the schematic of A to B is of course inversed, where you can see A on the top left and B on the bottom right.

When we pay attention to the schematic, what you can see is that it's basically the buy program inversed, meaning what you can see is that we see a market maker sell model schematic where there are two lines. First of all, this line on the downside represents your draw on liquidity, and the line on the upside—the green line—represents your point of interest.

### The Bearish Pattern

What I want you to see is that the market was consolidating down here. The function of this consolidation is to engineer sell-side liquidity. Sell-side liquidity is being engineered below these relative equal lows because a lot of retail-minded traders will be looking at those lows and will be thinking to themselves, "Hey, we reached a strong support zone—that's why the market is failing to reprice through this level."

We however know that this is not the case, and we know that this is the engineering of liquidity which is taking place. The market begins to expand towards the upside, and we see it retrace lower. Eventually it continues its expansion higher, and we see the market begin to draw towards the point of interest.

The moment that the point of interest gets met, we can be monitoring whether or not the signs become present of a reversal taking place. We see the market eventually form a swing high and begin to displace towards the downside.

Now notice that we displace below this low which set up that final run higher. We'll get to that in a bit. What I want you to understand is that we change from buy program to sell program, and therefore what you can anticipate is that every single retracement higher is likely going to be manipulation to distribute lower.

### Key Insight About Draw on Liquidity

And that is a key insight which I want you to take away from this lecture already, and that is that when you have a draw on liquidity established, you're actually looking for price runs against that draw on liquidity for a while. The reason why is because those price swings are more confirmation of your existing draw on liquidity to be the right draw on liquidity. Why? Because liquidity will seek to be engineered around your draw on liquidity, and that's something which you need to keep in mind.

Understand as well that we saw the market move from point A to point B, and now point B turns into point A to draw towards point B.

### Bearish Imbalances and Premium Arrays

When we pay attention to the imbalances then which get created on the left side of the curve throughout this buy side of the curve, what you can see is that I have annotated two imbalances—one right here and one inside this final expansion higher.

Now what I want you to keep in mind is that throughout this final run higher, what is taking place is that a lot of buy-side liquidity is being taken out. At the same time, what's taking place is that traders are being trapped into believing the markets are just going to continue running forever. Therefore, what you see is that there's speed and velocity which is taking place. Big up-close candles will step in.

It's in those big up-close candles and in recognition of the price pattern of an imbalance that you must be wary. The reason why is due to the fact that you understand that the point of interest has been met, also during a time of interest (which we'll discuss later throughout the Models series), and therefore you can anticipate a smart money reversal taking place.

The moment that the market displaces below that imbalance and we begin to see these discount arrays fail to function as support on price, we can anticipate that they're going to function as resistance on price moving forward, and that the order flow has changed from bullish to bearish—especially considering the fact that your draw on liquidity is down here.

## Chart Examples and Lower Time Frame Confirmation

When we pay attention to chart examples, what's important to notice is how we recognize bullish or bearish institutional order flow on a higher time frame chart and then drop into a lower time frame chart to confirm it by paying attention to how the market is reacting to new discount or premium arrays which are being created.

### Recognizing Change in State of Delivery

Guys, recognizing change in the state of delivery—where order flow is changing from sell program to buy program—is crucial. But please keep in mind that there's more that is required in order to confirm that order flow is in fact changing. And that is one of the most important things which I can share with you: Don't get lost in the lower time frames.

As I mentioned prior, focus on recognizing the higher time frame narrative. Do you see how I just outlined to you, based on a one-minute chart, the lower time frame buy program which is being seen unfolding right here? But without a proper understanding of the higher time frames, you would still probably get lost inside of this delivery.

Therefore, it's crucial that whenever you break down your trade, or you break down your backtesting work, or you break down my trades, it's crucial that you first always look at higher time frames to try and get the feeling for what the higher time frame narrative is, so that you can then go into the lower time frames and look to confirm that higher time frame narrative.

## The Importance of Low Resistance Liquidity Runs

This is what I mean when I outlined to you I'm interested in trading the low resistance liquidity runs. In order to define what the low resistance liquidity run is likely going to be, I pay attention to the higher time frames only. And based upon those higher time frames, I try to determine what's likely going to be a low resistance liquidity run and what not.

## Homework Assignment

I want to give you a homework assignment to end this lecture. I would like you to find 15 examples of a trending market in which you see one-sided order flow taking place. I want you to zoom into the lower timeframes and find the market maker models present, whether it be market maker buy models or market maker sell models.

I want you to annotate everything as detailed as possible, meaning I would like you to try and annotate everything which you see when it comes to:
- The PD arrays which you see
- Recognizing A to B (or the multiple A to B's)
- Recognizing the use of time cycles
- Recognizing maybe even intermarket relationships if you're already investigating that

Annotate absolutely everything, and the reason why is because it's inside of this assignment where you focus on spotting trending markets and looking at the lower time frame opportunities that you will be able to see that there are countless opportunities each period.

I hope that you enjoyed this lecture. I want to thank you for watching it all the way to the end. I look forward to speaking to you in the next one. Good luck with the assignment, and I look forward to seeing the charts coming in on the mentorship forum, because that is where I suggest you to post them if you want to receive my feedback. You can just tag me in the questions channel, and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as possible.

Good luck with your studies, and we'll speak soon again, Lord willing. Be safe.
