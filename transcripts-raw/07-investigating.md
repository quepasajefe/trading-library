# Investigating - 2025 Model Series Lecture 07

Hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is in a bit of a different format than what you're used to within this series, and the reason why is because I want to create a raw lecture for you in which I share with you how to actually investigate what I've taught so far.

I've taught a lot already within this Models series, and therefore it's important that you do not forget about going into the charts yourself and actually investigating what I've outlined. However, I understand that that can be quite tricky, and therefore I want to give you some examples of how you can actually go into the charts and investigate everything which I've taught so far.

## Using the Notion Database

Therefore, I'm going to be using the Notion template which has been provided within my mentorship. I will share with you where you can claim access to it. You can claim access to this Notion database which I'm going to show to you now right here. You can claim access to it by going to the description, and you're able to see a link there. If you press on that link, you'll be able to find the steps to copy and paste this Notion. We're going to be using this Notion to just basically outline some opportunities so that you're able to get a grasp of how I'm actually going into the charts myself and how I actually backtest myself.

## The Right Way to Backtest

Now, when it comes to backtesting, what a lot of people do is they utilize the replay tool and they place the replay tool wherever and then just go candle by candle and they try to basically predict what's going to happen next within delivery that has already occurred. I'm sure that some of you are probably like, "Damn, you just nailed me." Yes.

However, I do not believe that that's an effective way of backtesting, and the reason why is because your goal throughout backtesting is to train your eye to see algorithmic signatures. It is to train your eye to see these repeating phenomena within the delivery of price. Therefore, your job is to play a volume game where you're able to say, "Okay, I'm going to get a lot of examples of the same algorithmic signatures taking place, and therefore I know that this is what's going to happen next when I see a similar situation in the future."

Meaning, my opinion of backtesting is that backtesting should merely function as a data collecting tool. All I want you to start thinking about when you come to the charts with the desire to look at the historical market data is to train your eye to improve your ability to see these signatures within the delivery of price. So that in the future, when you get to live markets and you can do tape reading or you can trade demo, you're able to recognize them. And therefore I'm going to show to you how I go about this.

## Determining Higher Time Frame Institutional Order Flow

So first of all, my main objective is the following: The main objective is to determine what the higher time frame institutional order flow is.

Over these past couple of months, we have been bearish on the indices, and in front of you, you have the daily chart of the Nasdaq, by the way. Because we have been bearish on the Nasdaq, what it means is that we have been looking for lower prices, and therefore we are going to be looking for shorting opportunities which present themselves throughout this repricing lower.

You might be wondering, "How do you know that the institutional order flow is bearish? How do you know that the market was being repriced towards the downside?" Well, there's a lot which we can discuss in order to confirm that we were in a sell program. But for now, I would like you to understand that when we pay attention to this delivery here, what I would like you to see is that on the bottom right here, we see time. And what this represents is it represents basically the months. Because in front of you we have a daily chart, and you can see that we have January, February, March, April.

My eye is immediately always drawn to where the previous month's high and the previous month's low are. I'm just going to show you where the January low is. The January low is right here. And when we pay attention to where the January high is, what I would like you to see is that the January high is up here.

Throughout the month of February, which opened up right here—and by the way, I walked you all through this live in real time when the market was delivering, so don't think I'm always just sitting in hindsight. Now, if you pay attention to the market reviews at that time, you will have seen that I literally outlined this full sell program before it occurred, targeting sell-side liquidity objectives.

### Monthly Analysis

But what I would like you to see is that February opened up, ran up higher, took out January high, but did not utilize the January high as support on price. Eventually the market rolled over inside of this box right here. And I have severe OCD, by the way, so I need to make sure that everything is just clean, and that is what you will notice. So I apologize that this is going to be a very raw lecture, but I hope that you will find great benefit in seeing how I'm actually coming to the charts and actually basically going about my day-to-day process, because it's so important that these small little details get investigated.

So what I would like you to see is that the market failed to utilize the January high as support on price and rolled over. What is it drawn towards? Well, the market is drawn towards January low, which is right here. Notice that we slammed through that low with this big down-close candle. And we then see something get created right here. What gets created? We see an FVG get created. We can extend this FVG to the right right here. And the reason why is because as long as this FVG functions as resistance on price, we are bearish and we are expecting lower prices to come.

But when you pay attention to the January low by itself, what you can see is that I can extend that to the right as well. And what do you notice? We expanded below the January low. And do you see how we retrace into the January low? We wick up off it, but notice that the bodies keep on closing inside of this. This shows to you that a continuation model is in play, where at first we saw a purge and revert from January high to January low. We are now seeing continuation take place. And when you see continuation taking place, you can anticipate that we're going to see further repricing lower.

## Logging Opportunities - Example 1: Monday

Now that we have defined that the underlying order flow has been bearish, what I'm going to do is I'm going to press right here on the top right, where it says the screen—what do you call it? The camera, my bad, sorry. And I'm going to press and take a snapshot. I'm going to press on copy image. And I'm going to go to the Notion tool.

And what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a new page right here. And this new page is going to be filled with opportunities which we're going to log now. I'm going to copy-paste the image which I've just collected. And this is the daily chart of Nasdaq.

The next chart which I'm going to log is the hourly chart of Nasdaq. So when we go to the hourly chart of Nasdaq, what I would like you to see is that when we pay attention to this past week's delivery, it's important to note that we have seen a trending week where the market initially opened up, ran up higher, and eventually began rolling over.

When we pay attention to this week, I would like you to understand that every single swing point right here was absolutely algorithmically driven, meaning every single swing point was anticipated. And that right there is something which I want to show to you. And that's what we're going to be looking at during this raw lecture.

### Monday's Setup

All right. First of all, let us begin with Monday. On Monday, I outlined that I would be monitoring the 19,000 price level. The 19,000 price level was my objective that I anticipated price to draw towards.

You know what? Let's actually do it fully, how I'm doing it when I'm actually going through logging all the charts and such. What I do is I place the replay tool right here on the day itself, and I go to the APR indicator. And what I actually do is I place the ranges right here on the 10,000 because we're on Nasdaq, and then I have the ranges.

What I would like you to see is that we saw the market stop right in advance of that 19,000 price level when we formed this low right here. So we engineered sell-side liquidity right here. We saw the market consolidate for a while, and we saw it go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Eventually, the New York morning session opens up, and we see the market begin to expand towards the downside. Notice that the market reaches that 19,000 price level. We just step below it, and we then form a low and begin expanding towards the upside.

Now, when we pay attention to a swing formation like this—because that is what our focus is going to be on, recognizing market swings—it's important to note that we pay attention to time cycles and price cycles. And we could even look at PD arrays, but in this case, I do not need any PD arrays because we're at levels which have been met a long time ago. We have to go far back into the past before you could even see any arrays, and therefore it's simply not worth it looking at the arrays. Simply focus on the time cycles and key levels.

What I would like you to see is that we see liquidity engineered in advance of what? In advance of that 19,000 price level right here. What low is this? This is the Asia low. When we pay attention to where the London low formed, what I would like you to see is that the London low formed right here. So the London low also formed in advance of that 19,000 price level.

So what exactly does New York do? Well, what New York does is that it opens low, drops into this 19,000 price level, and this full leg which I'm outlining now from the New York open (which takes place at 7 AM) to the absolute low which forms—that right there is manipulation which is taking place. We just wick below that 19,000 price level, and we see the market eventually expand towards the upside, drawing towards a new opening gap, which is right here.

### Documenting the Trade

What I would like you to see is that inside of this delivery, there are a few things which you can recognize from that hourly chart already. You can recognize the engineering of liquidity, you can recognize the influence of time cycles, and you can recognize where manipulation is taking place.

So what I'm basically going to do is I'm going to outline this to be the Asia low, and I want you to keep in mind that the London low is right here, and I'm going to save this chart. And we're just going to stick to the hourly chart, by the way. I'm just showing you how you can recognize these opportunities on the higher time frames at first, where you can short into that 19,000 price level like I did, and you can also buy afterwards like I did as well, because that is the power of this information.

I'm not saying that you should go out here and trade based upon this information. I'm just sharing with you my thought process and my logic, and this is a real raw insight on how I'm actually doing so.

What we're then going to do is we're going to type "H1 hourly," and we're going to look at—and the reason why we're just going to stick to the hourly chart is because I want you to understand that based upon the hourly chart, you can already see these moves taking place. Meaning, all you need to define is you need to define where the draw on liquidity is and where the point of interest is within a trending market.

So what we're going to do is we're going to look at the date. This date was the 31st of March. The day was Monday. Market was Nasdaq. Session was New York AM since we're looking at that opportunity. News—we would have to go to the Forex Factory and actually check whether or not there was news on that day. SMR time, we're not going to worry about now. SMT, we're also not going to worry about now. We're simply focusing on everything which we can look at from the hourly chart.

## Logging Opportunities - Example 2: Tuesday

When we pay attention to the charts again, what I would like you to see is the following. What I would like you to see is that we saw the market expand higher from that 19,000 price level. I'm just going to remove my drawings because we're going to continue to the next log.

I outlined throughout my review on Tuesday on this day that I anticipated that as long as we would not see the market displace below this FVG right here, I would anticipate that we would likely draw towards the upside. What was my eye drawn towards? Well, my eye was initially drawn towards the 19,500 price level right here. And the reason why is because what do you see? You see that we stopped on Monday right in advance of that level. And therefore, what you see is that this is engineered buy-side liquidity.

So what I'm looking for is the following: I'm looking for the market to expand towards the level. And what do you see here? Do you see how the market repriced higher, drawing towards that buy-side liquidity pool, reaching that 19,500 price level and then rejects it right here?

This right here shows you that buying opportunities presented themselves throughout this run higher, that shorting opportunities presented themselves after. And again, because the higher time frame institutional order flow is bearish, I'm more interested in the shorting opportunity.

### The Manipulation Phase

What I would like you to see is that we see the market expand towards that previous day high, which is right here, throughout the London session. We see the market eventually take out previous day high. And we see the market reach the 19,500 price level. Do you also see how the market reached a daily FVG by doing so? Because remember on the daily chart, this was the daily FVG which I had outlined.

When we pay attention to the hourly chart then, what I would like you to see is that the market repriced higher, taking out the previous day high, reaching the daily FVG, reaching the 19,500 price level, forming SMT with ES, and then repriced towards the downside. What do you see? You see a perfect swing high formation, and therefore on the lower time frames, this is a market maker sell model which is present—specifically within these three candles, but maybe I'll discuss that later.

Therefore, what we're going to focus on is the following: This whole run higher, I'm just going to make that annotation—this whole run higher right here is all manipulation. And therefore that run higher is all the engineering of sell-side liquidity. They're trapping people into believing higher prices are next and they're actually making them believe that they should go long on the market. Now engineering sell-side liquidity so that when enough buy-side liquidity has been taken out, we will revert towards sell-side liquidity.

## Session Analysis

When we pay attention to the delivery, what I would like you to see is that you could argue that this is a consolidation. And therefore I'm still going to log Asia as a consolidation. And that's how I'm going to log it: Asia consolidation, London expansion—but expansion in both directions, because London both expanded higher and expanded lower, meaning it ran up higher and then it ran down lower. Buy side of the curve, sell side of the curve—full market maker sell model. Absolutely beautiful. All originating from what? From that key level and the previous day high with SMT.

Now when we fast forward to the delivery, what I would like you to see is that the market eventually reprices higher and spends more time inside the daily FVG. What does the market reach? Well, the market reaches our next objective. What was our next objective? Well, I would want on this day that after that 19,500 price level, the next objective which I had for Nasdaq on the upside would be the FVG right here, this weekly FVG.

## Important Notes on Session Trading

Could you be looking at Asia? Yes and no. The concepts which I'm teaching to you based on time and price cycles work across all sessions—that's a given. However, I do not understand why you would want to look at Asia session over, for example, London or New York AM, New York PM.

Now I understand the argument that it might fit better in your schedule, but at the end of the day, the delivery is not as clean as within those other sessions. So therefore, choose wisely whether or not you would be willing to look at the Asia session.

## The Core Focus

This has a deeper meaning, and when I am going to explain this to you, I'm going to do this throughout a specific lecture in the future where I'm going to outline to you that all that matters is that you recognize sell and buy program. Sell and buy program—that's the only two variables which you need to know. Are we in a sell program or are we in a buy program?

Why? Because in a sell program, every single premium array will function as resistance. In a buy program, every single discount array will function as support on price.

## Using the Time Cycles Indicator

What I would like you to see is that we have these nice boxes. These boxes are being plotted by the time cycles indicator, and I'm sure that the majority of you probably already have it on your screens. However, if you don't yet, go to the mentorship platform, go to resources, and you can find the time cycles indicator. You can find the advanced price ranges indicator. You can find all this stuff which you need, which is like an extra besides educational content which is available here on the mentorship platform. And I really suggest you to make use of those resources.

What I would like you to see is that we have this green shaded box. This green shaded box represents the 90-minute cycle from 10 to 11:30 AM. This is the final 90-minute cycle of the morning session. Notice that when I outline the high of this 90-minute cycle, it's right here—meaning this is the AM high. Do you see how at 11:30 AM we opened up for lunch when the AM high reached that FVG? And we then saw the market eventually roll over.

That right there shows you that we purged the AM high and we then reverted towards the low. We didn't however reach the full low because the full low was down here, but we came back into a deep discount of the range which was established up until that point—the range being like this, the range of the previous session and the previous cycle. That's something which I didn't teach yet. However, we run the high and then revert towards the downside, drawing towards sell-side liquidity. Beautiful sell program.

## Summary and Key Takeaways

Now, when we're paying attention to everything which we have discussed during this lecture, during this showcase video, I would like you to understand that based upon the hourly chart, you're able to see these lower time frame opportunities. Meaning, simply based upon this hourly chart or the M15 chart within our final example, you're able to just go out here, you're able to see market maker sell models, market maker buy models, etc.

Everything which I've done so far throughout these lectures up until this point all have to do with recognizing swing points. Recognizing: Are we now changing from sell to buy program or from buy to sell program? That is what I want you to focus on within your studies right now.

Later we're going to dive into all of these lower time frame signatures that I'm going to share with you. But for now, focus on those higher time frames. If you have the experience already, you can drop into the lower time frames and investigate the delivery as it took place. However, I believe that for the majority of you, it's better to just train your eyes to see these bigger price swings and understand the lower time frame fractals.

With that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that you found it insightful, and I hope that everything when it comes to audio quality etc. was good, because right now I'm on holiday as I'm actually recording this. But I really wanted to get a lecture out for the Models series, so I hope that you found it insightful. Let me know in the mentorship forum if you did, and I want to wish you good luck in your studies. I look forward to speaking to you soon again in a new presentation. Be safe.
