# Points of Interest - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the Models series. During this lecture, I will be discussing points of interest with you.

## Methods to Determine Points of Interest

The methods to determine the points of interest are exactly the same as the methods which I outlined during the previous lecture in which I explained the draw on liquidity. However, there are some subtle things which I would like to share with you during this lecture which are very important to note.

First of all, we will be looking at PD arrays as points of interest. Secondly, we will be paying attention to time cycles as points of interest. And thirdly, we will be paying attention to key levels as points of interest.

Now before we dive into this lecture, I would like to share with you that it's very important that you have gone through the previous lectures and that you have studied them in depth. The reason why is because there is a sequence in which I am explaining everything within this Models series. If you are not following the sequence and you are simply just picking these lectures from lecture one to lecture five and then you go to lecture two or lecture four or whatever, and then lecture three, the whole sequence is disrupted. Meaning you need to make sure that you watch this series in the right order because I am explaining everything in a specific order.

## Understanding Point A and Point B

Now what we will focus on during this lecture is the following: We will be focusing on determining point A. On the left right here—on the bottom left within a buy program and on the top left within a sell program. Point A is inception of the new program, whether it be a buy program towards the upside or sell program towards the downside.

By utilizing points of interest, we are able to anticipate where point A will form, meaning where we would likely see the smart money reversal form. Point B represents the draw on liquidity. That's the terminus. That's the end of our basically anticipated program, whether it be buy or sell program. And that is where we begin with determining point B (the terminus and draw on liquidity), and then we look at where the point of interest is.

## Method 1: PD Arrays as Points of Interest

When we pay attention to PD arrays, I have shared the schematic which you see in front of you prior during this series as well. I am just going to walk you through it quickly again.

What I would like you to see is that in front of you, you can see the PD arrays matrix. This PD array matrix was created by the Inner Circle Trader. Full credit goes out to him, and he basically shared this sequence in which all the price patterns which he has coined are presented. Meaning what you can see is that inside of any given dealing range, what you can see is that there's a premium side and a discount side. Below 50% is discount and above 50% is premium.

What you can see is that inside of both the premium and the discount, these price patterns are forming, whether it be for example, the rejection block, whether it be the bearish order block, whether it be the fair value gap, the liquidity void, bearish breaker or bearish mitigation block, and the same for the discount arrays, but then in the opposing order.

Now, when it comes to these arrays, it's important to note that we can blend these with time cycles and key levels to basically anticipate where swing points are going to form. And that is what I will teach you during this lecture.

### The Fractal Nature of PD Arrays

When we pay attention to an example of this taking place, what you could see is that on the left, you can see a higher time frame chart of any given market. And on the right, you can see the lower time frames.

What I would like you to see is that on this higher time frame chart, what you see is that the market has expanded towards the upside and it's retraced lower. What has the market retraced into? The market retraced into a bullish fair value gap, which formed throughout this expansion higher.

What happens throughout this retracement lower is that sellers are being trapped into believing lower prices are next, meaning a lot of sellers will look to go short, place their stop loss above this high, because they believe the high is in. What will the market be repriced into? It will be repriced into this old area of inefficiency, filling the imbalance so that the market is then allowed to expand towards the upside.

What it looks like on the lower time frames is the following: On the lower time frames, it means that we're seeing a market maker buy model—original consolidation, sell side of the curve into that higher time frame imbalance, followed by the buy side of the curve.

Now, when you pay attention to this framework right here, it's important to note that this is all fractal. Notice that I haven't put in any time frames. I've not put in, "Oh, this is an hourly chart, this is a one-minute chart." No. Why not? Because on the left, it could be a monthly chart and on the right, it could be a daily chart.

What I would like you to see is that I didn't put in a specific timeframe for the higher time frame and the lower time frame. And the reason why is because everything is fractal. Therefore what you must note is that regardless of what time frame you're looking at, as long as you know what a higher time frame is and a lower time frame, you can anticipate where these swing formations are going to take place.

### Key Insight: Expansion-Retracement-Expansion

**A higher time frame expansion followed by retracement followed by expansion is a lower time frame market maker model.**

Keep that in mind. You're probably going to hear me say that more often throughout this lecture. So buckle up for that.

### Bullish Breaker as Point of Interest

When we pay attention to bullish breakers, what you can see is that the market expanded towards the downside, it ran up higher (retraced higher), and we then saw one more leg towards the downside take place. Notice that the market displaced above the high which set up that final run lower. 

What's important to note here is that the final run lower has to be into some form of point of interest, but that's something which we'll discuss way later within this series. Notice that the market retraces into the price range of that bullish breaker, and we then see the market eventually expand towards the upside.

Inside of the fractal of this retracement lower followed by this expansion higher, you will see a lower time frame market maker buy model. Why? Because inside of this retracement lower, what's taking place is that sellers are being trapped into believing that we're going to see lower prices next, meaning a lot of sellers are being induced into the marketplace.

What will IPDA seek to do? It will seek to reprice back into the price range of this bullish breaker so that smart money is being given the opportunity to buy and position themselves long inside of the price range. That is why on the lower time frames, you will see the sell side of the curve followed by the buy side of the curve. Where will the buy side of the curve originate from? The buy side of the curve will originate from the price range of that bullish breaker.

### Balance Price Ranges

What I would like you to start thinking about is why PD arrays work in the first place. When you start thinking about why PD arrays work in the first place, you come to realize that it's all to do with balancing out of specific ranges. And that's what we refer to as balance price ranges.

In this case, what you see is that sell side of the curve takes place, where you can see that the market is repriced towards the downside. And what's happening throughout the sell side of the curve is that sell side is being delivered. When we then see the market run up higher, we see the buy side of the curve being delivered.

However, it's important to note that we're not referring to a market maker sell or market maker buy model now in the sense of the traditional market maker model fractals as you know them. No, we're simply looking at delivery functions, where you have two functions of delivery: either sell side or buy side.

And what you see is that the market delivers sell side, buy side. And eventually, it offers sell side through this low right here with this FVG. And therefore what you can anticipate is that the market has to offer buy side into that again. Why? Because we saw twice sell side delivery and we saw once buy side delivery. Let me repeat that: Sell side, buy side, sell side.

This is why breakers work, guys. It's all about understanding balance price ranges. And yes, I promise that I will discuss them more in depth later within this Models series.

### Rejection Blocks

When we pay attention to rejection blocks, they form when price creates a swing point with a long wick. This wick extends to the right and becomes our point of interest.

For a bullish rejection block, the market expands towards the downside and eventually you'll see a low formation take place. Inside this low formation, you will see that there's a very long wick which will form. This wick will be extended to the right. The reason why is because this wick is your bullish rejection block.

For a bearish rejection block, the market expands towards the upside and eventually forms a swing high. It's inside of this swing high formation that there will be a long wick which will extend to the right.

When it comes to looking at rejection blocks, pay attention to intermarket relationships.

## Method 2: Time Cycles as Points of Interest

When it comes to time cycles, it's important to note that you have watched the prior lecture on the topic in which I outlined what time cycles exactly are. If you did not watch that lecture yet, I highly suggest you to stop watching this lecture and go back to the previous lecture.

### Dynamic Highs and Lows

When it comes to time cycles, it's important to note that we have a specific high, which is represented by the green line, and a low, which is represented by this red line. These highs and lows will form during specific windows of time. When it comes to time cycles, it's important to note that time cycles' highs and lows are dynamic.

You might be wondering, "Dynamic, what does that mean?" Well, that means that the time cycle highs and lows change for any particular time cycle as time progresses. 

For example, if we are paying attention to Monday's morning session, where the high of the morning session formed right here at this price level, and the low of the morning session formed right here at this price level. When we pay attention to the next day, Tuesday's morning session, you can see that the high and low of that morning session have changed, meaning both levels have moved towards the upside.

What is the significance of this? Well, the significance of this is that you can see that the engineering of liquidity is taking place around different levels, and keep this in mind moving forward.

### Purge and Revert with Time Cycles

What we'll be looking for when it comes to time cycles is mainly the following: We'll be looking for a purge and revert to take place.

**In bullish markets:** We are going to look for an open low, where the market is going to open low, taking out sell-side liquidity resting below the previous cycle low, followed by reversal higher to draw towards the previous cycle high.

**In bearish markets:** We'll be looking for open high, where the market will seek to open up, run up higher, taking out buy-side liquidity resting above the previous cycle high, followed by a reversal towards the downside, drawing towards the previous cycle low.

It's in this process where the market takes out that previous cycle high or that previous cycle low that you must understand that this is manipulation which is taking place, where the final manipulation leg is taking place before the reversal will unfold.

## Method 3: Key Levels as Points of Interest

When it comes to key levels, you must note that key levels are fixed. And the reason why I'm mentioning this is due to the following: The reason why I'm mentioning this is because key levels are fixed levels, whereas the time cycles' highs and lows are dynamic. The time cycles' highs and lows change, meaning their price goes up and down. However, when it comes to these key levels, they remain the same regardless of what price did in the past or regardless of what new time cycle is opening. It doesn't change.

Meaning we always have a specific range in which we have four quadrants. That is a very important insight which I want you to keep in mind, because there's a big difference between key levels and time cycle highs and lows.

### When Do Key Levels Become Significant?

I would like you to think about the following question: When do key levels become significant?

If you would like to pause the lecture to have a good thought about it, I really suggest you to do so. And the reason why is because that way you're able to think for yourself and then compare that to how I'm about to explain it to you. And I know that the majority of you are probably not going to pause the lecture, you're probably already skipping ahead. But yeah, in order for you to have crazy light bulb moments, you must be able to think for yourself and then compare that to how I'm about to explain it to you.

**Key levels become significant when they get blended with the element of time.**

It's time, then price. Meaning time without price means nothing, just as price without time means nothing. But when we align the two, when we blend the two elements, that is when we can anticipate what's likely going to happen next.

## Blending All Three Methods

What's important to note when it comes to these key levels is that they are not always going to be respected to the tick perfectly, meaning sometimes you must allow for the market to simply move beyond them a bit. Meaning when the market just goes below this horizontal line which represents a key level, you're not thinking to yourself, "Okay, it's going to continue dropping, it's going to continue dumping." No, you're still anticipating that the low formation to take place.

These key levels are here to provide you with structure behind your analysis. Same with these time cycle highs and lows—the reaction to them will be very telling.

### The Power of Confluence

What I want you to investigate is the following: I want you to investigate the liquidity being engineered in advance of key levels. When you start paying attention to the higher time frame PD arrays as well that are in close proximity to these levels, you'll begin to see repeating signatures there.

Meaning your focus should be on blending all of these different elements which I've outlined to you during this lecture when it comes to points of interest selection. Because once you start blending all these different elements, you will see exactly where these turning points are forming.

## Summary

These market maker models are not simply price patterns. They're not price patterns that you just plot on your chart and that's it. No, what you must understand is the logic behind inception to terminus. And that right there is where the true light bulb moments will take place.

Every single entry is someone else's exit. Every single exit will be someone else's entry. And that is one of the most fascinating things which you can see on the mentorship forum, where you can literally see students just go back and forth—buy, sell, sell, buy, etc., over and over again. It's almost as if we're handing over positions to each other.

And some of you are probably smiling because you have experienced that probably with me where I would have taken a trade and you then took the opposing side of that trade later, meaning I initially went long, targeted an old high, when the market reached that high, it turned around and you went short. And that is what we refer to as playing ping pong. And it's one of the most beautiful things to see because it shows you that there are plenty of opportunities when you understand both draw on liquidity selection and point of interest selection.

## Homework Assignment

As a homework assignment, what I would like you to do is I would like you to find 15 examples of price reaching a point of interest based upon either a higher time frame PD array, time cycle, or key level, and price rejecting it.

Meaning I would like you to begin training, based upon a higher time frame chart, your ability to recognize what points of interest are. Once you're able to recognize what points of interest are and you're able to see these rejections taking place, you must understand that on the lower time frames, market maker models will present themselves.

I want you to look at both the higher time frame and the lower time frame chart, meaning I want you to save both a screenshot of the higher time frame and the lower time frame chart. So for example, an hourly and a one-minute chart, and I would like you to annotate them as in depth as possible, meaning be sure to fill in all of the blank areas on the chart with text or with symbols, etc., showing what you're seeing within the markets.

Keep in mind, blending the different elements leads to more significant POI selection, and that is what I would like to end this lecture with. Meaning your focus should be on blending all of these different elements which I've outlined to you during this lecture when it comes to points of interest selection. Because once you start blending all these different elements, you will see exactly where these turning points are forming.

And that is something which you can only find out by investigating on your own. So now it's time for you to go into the charts and investigate what I outlined to you. I want you to go into the charts with an open mind and I want you to investigate everything which I explained to you during this lecture.

I want to thank you for watching this lecture all the way to the end. Good work with your studies and I look forward to speaking to you in the next one. Be safe!
