# Entry Patterns - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. During this lecture I will be discussing a requested topic, and that is entry patterns. Entry patterns are methods of getting into the marketplace. It's important to understand that entry patterns by themselves mean absolutely nothing, and that is something which I'm going to put emphasis on during this lecture. With that being said, let us dive into today's lecture.

## The Foundation of Entry Patterns

First of all, I want you to understand that an entry pattern is a way of getting into the move from point A to point B. That's all an entry pattern is. It's nothing more than that. The entry pattern itself is the least of importance. Your job is recognizing A to B. Pick your favorites and stick to them.

What I mean by this is the following: In due time, you are going to have tried out multiple entry patterns and you're going to have seen which ones suit your personality and which ones don't. Some of you could be taking a particular entry pattern whilst others take a completely different entry pattern. Whilst in reality, it doesn't really matter what entry pattern you choose, because as long as you're good at recognizing point of interest to draw on liquidity, then everything will fall into place.

## Understanding Point A to Point B

Here we are at the example which I've been utilizing throughout this full Models series. Inside of this chart, what you can see is point A to point B, and what this represents is the following. What this represents is a bearish expansion towards the downside where you can see that the market moved from this inception to this terminus, with point A being inception and point B being terminus. It's inside of this range that your entry patterns on the downside—meaning bearish entry patterns—will present themselves.

I'm going to walk you through three entry patterns which I believe to be the most important, and I'm going to share my thoughts on each one of them.

## The Breaker Block

First of all, we're going to be paying attention to the breaker block. The breaker block is, in my opinion, one of the strongest algorithmic signatures which you can look for, and the reason why is due to the following.

When it comes to trading low risk sales within any market maker sell model, it's important to understand that the breaker block itself is basically the first real entry opportunity after the smart money reversal has taken place. Meaning what the breaker block looks like is the following:

What I would like to see is that the market expands towards the upside and we see a high get created. A retracement occurs and we then see the market create a higher high. When the market then displaces below this low which set up the creation of that higher high, we are waiting for the market to retrace back into that low, into that down close candle, because that is our bearish breaker.

The moment that price displaces below the breaker's low right here, what we can look for is we can look for a retracement into that low. And when the market retraces into that low, that's a potential entry. Our stop loss will be placed above the smart money reversal, meaning above this high. If you would like to be a bit more aggressive, you could also place it above the breaker's high, but there are specific rules on that when it comes to, for example, lower time frame balance price ranges, which I will discuss later throughout this series.

But what is important to note is that when it comes to breaker blocks, it's important that you begin looking for these from your point of interest. Meaning don't go into the charts and simply say, "Oh, I see a breaker block there, therefore it's a trade." No, that right there is a common misconception which a lot of people make.

Look, you must understand that the logic from point A to point B is crucial. Meaning point A has to be recognized, because when you see the market expand away from point A and you have already predefined point B, only then will you consider taking a bearish breaker block entry on your demo account. Of course, I will never tell you to go out here and trade on a live account. I'm not a financial advisor. I'm not putting myself at any risk. However, if you get confident with this entry setup and you see it play out again and again and again, you can decide for yourself whether or not you would ever want to put real money at risk right there.

## The Mitigation Block

When we pay attention to the second entry pattern then, the second entry pattern looks like the following, and this is the mitigation block. What the mitigation block basically is, is exactly the same as the bearish breaker—there is one adjustment, and what the adjustment is is the following.

What I would like to see is that the breaker created a higher high, but with the mitigation block, what you can see is that a lower high got created. Meaning we saw the market expand towards the upside, a retracement occurred, and we then saw the market form this low. The market expands higher, but notice that it does not take out this previous high. Instead, we create a lower high.

The reason why this is important is because when market one does this, whilst market two, for example, creates that bearish breaker, we're seeing SMT. Meaning one market creates a mitigation block whilst the other market creates a breaker. Something to think about.

When the market displaces below this down close candle, and we see the market retrace into that low, that's a potential shorting opportunity. We can place our stop loss above the high which set up the expansion lower. Keep in mind that this is how we trade a mitigation block.

Now, I can already hear you ask yourself, "But is there one pattern which is stronger than the other? Is there a difference between the significance of a breaker or a mitigation block?" No, there isn't. Meaning, I want you to understand that both a breaker and a mitigation block both have the same level of significance, and the reason why that is the case is because they are both swing formations which are occurring. It's always either a breaker formation or it's a mitigation block formation. There's no other way.

Meaning, you must understand that inside of every single market reversal that takes place, you will see either a breaker or mitigation block. When you see one market create a breaker whilst the other market creates a mitigation block, that is SMT. And if you have watched my lecture on SMT, on smart money divergence, you should already have seen that.

## The Fair Value Gap

When we pay attention to the third entry pattern then, what I would like to see is that the third entry pattern is the fair value gap. And this is a rather simple entry in my opinion, and it's also the entry pattern which in my opinion stands out the most. I can come to any chart and I can just mark up fair value gaps just like this.

What I would like to see is that what the fair value gap creation looks like is the following. What you can see is that there are three candles which get created right here towards the downside. Notice that when we pay attention to candle one's low right here, and candle two expands through candle one's low. Notice that candle three then doesn't reprice higher back into candle one's low. Instead, we see the high form below it.

That right there sets up the creation of a fair value gap, where there is a lack of buy side delivery between the range of this low—so candle one's low—and candle three's high. That means that price will seek to retrace into that FVG, into that bearish fair value gap, and we will see the market offer buy side into that, and that is our entry opportunity.

When we enter in a fair value gap, our stop loss is always placed above candle one's high right here. One thing which I want you to understand is that it's possible that there are multiple fair value gaps in a row. In my chart example, you can see that that's not the case because I've chosen to just show one fair value gap, but if there is another fair value gap above here, you must allow for the market to trade into that fair value gap, meaning your stop will even be wider then.

Now again, the entry pattern itself is the least of importance. Meaning we pay attention to becoming very good at recognizing point A to point B, and the entry pattern is simply the method we use to get in sync with that move.

Now there are ways of anticipating that fair value gaps are likely going to be left intact. This has to do with breakaway gaps, but again, this is something which we're going to discuss later. For now, it is important that you begin recognizing what these patterns within the delivery of price look like.

## Chart Example Analysis - Bearish

What we're going to do is we're going to look at a chart example. In front of you, you can see a chart example, and I would like you to pause this lecture for a moment, and I would like you to investigate where you can see the creation of the arrays as I've just outlined to you. I would like you to investigate where your entry would be.

I hope that you paused the lecture because I'm now going to add my lipstick to the chart. What I would like to show is that inside of this delivery, what you can see is that the market was consolidating right here. We then see it expand towards the upside, and we see this high form right here. We then see the market expand lower aggressively, and do you see that throughout this expansion towards the downside, there are two imbalances which get created? We see one imbalance form up here, and a second imbalance right below it.

When the market retraces into the lowest imbalance right here, that's a potential shorting opportunity. But keep in mind that simply looking at this chart, you might be thinking to yourself, "But why is this a short then?" There's of course a way bigger picture in mind here, why I took this short exactly at this price level. However, I want you to understand that when it comes to entry patterns and becoming good at recognizing them, all you do is you pay attention to, "Okay, where does price expand from?" So this is point A, and let's say that point B is down here.

You look for an expansion lower, a retracement higher, and you pay attention to where the high of that retracement forms. And what you can see is that it forms inside of this FVG right here. We see the market expand lower, and notice that we take out sell side liquidity resting below this low. Instead of continuing expanding towards the downside, we form this low right here. We see the market retrace higher once more, trading into that lower FVG, into that lower bearish fair value gap, and we then see the market expand towards the downside once more.

What I would like to show when you pay close attention to this delivery here, is that we have this down close candle right here. Do you see how the market expands below that down close candle's range, and how the next candle retraces into that range? Notice, however, that we did not create a lower low yet relative to this low. We see the market take out this low right here, and notice how the market retraces into that long wick right here. What's happening here is that this price range is being balanced out, and balanced price ranges are crucial to understand.

But what I would like to show is that when we pay attention to this delivery, you can see that this higher fair value gap was left intact, and the reason why was because there was no reason for the market to reprice into that fair value gap. Think about the logic of inversion to fair value gaps when you pay attention to the left right here.

As a newer student, I would suggest the idea of using a wider stop, but as a more experienced student that has already gotten a good understanding of balanced price ranges, you should be able to understand why this gap was allowed to be left intact, and you understand why that is actually the invalidation level for this idea. Meaning you don't want to see the market trade into that gap.

## Chart Example Analysis - Another Bearish Setup

When we pay attention to another chart example, what I would like to do is I would like you to pause the lecture once again, and I would like you to try and see where the entry patterns present themselves.

Now, please keep in mind that when you are looking at this chart, you might see different entry patterns than the ones that I'm about to highlight, and that's all right. You must understand that everyone has their own personality. Everyone has their own perception, so to say, about the markets. Don't run away from your personality. Do that what feels best to you. Meaning if you are not confident in trading lower sales, then wait for that next displacement leg, wait for that next event to form, for example.

I hope that you paused the lecture because I'm going to add my lipstick to the chart now. Here you can see my annotations on the chart, and what I would like to show is that we saw the market expand towards the upside, but notice that this was a very slow expansion, where I could see that the market was just grinding towards the upside.

Eventually, the market begins to roll over right here, and we begin to see it displace towards the downside. What I would like to show is that we see a bearish breaker formation, where you can see that we formed this high, the market then retraced, and this big down close candle forms, and the market reprices higher, creating a higher high relative to this high.

We then see the market displace towards the downside with this sequence of imbalances. Do you see how big those candles are? Sell side liquidity is taken, and we see the market retrace into that imbalance before expanding towards the downside.

Now, one thing which is important to notice is that when it comes to these entry patterns, we can look for these entry patterns to line up with each other, meaning we can stack them on top of each other. One of the best ways to look at this is, for example, when you look at the bearish breaker, and you pair that with, for example, a FVG forming inside of that range. Now, notice that the market retraces into both the bearish breaker, as that FVG, as in that bearish fair value gap, and the market expands lower.

Again, if you are not confident yet in this entry right here, what you can wait for is you can wait for the next imbalance to form. Meaning what you can see is that we form a new imbalance right here, during this expansion that goes lower, and the market retraces into that imbalance, and that's, again, a potential shorting opportunity. The stop loss gets placed above this high right here, because that high should remain intact.

Now, notice that the market expands towards the downside beautifully after some short consolidation here, and it draws towards point B. Again, keep in mind point A to point B. It's not simply the entry pattern, and therefore when you look straight, there's way more to it.

Now, one thing which I would like you to think about is the following. What I would like you to think about is how the left side of the curve influences the right side of the curve, because if you begin looking to pair these entry patterns, what you can look for is you can look at the significance of the left side of the curve to anticipate where these entry patterns are going to be presented on the right side of the curve, and that's something to think about.

## Bullish Entry Patterns

When we pay attention to the opposing side then, we're going to be looking at bullish examples. So, when it comes to bullish examples, it's important to note that we anticipate price to move from point A, which is down here, to point B, which is up here. Instead of looking for sells, we are going to be looking for bullish entry patterns.

Again, point A is the inception of this bullish expansion, and point B is the terminus. The schematics themselves for the entry patterns are mirrored versus, however, I'm going to still walk you through every single one of them.

### Bullish Breaker Block

Here, we can see the breaker block. When it comes to the breaker block within a bullish scenario, it looks like the following. Where you can see that the market expanded towards the downside, and we formed this low. A retracement occurred, and we see the market form this high in here. The market then expands towards the downside one more time, taking out this previous low.

When the market takes out this low, and we see it then displace above this old high, which set up that final expansion lower, the last up close candle right here becomes our bullish breaker. When the market retraces into that up close candle, that right there is our potential buying opportunity. Our stop loss gets placed below the smart money reversal right here, and that's the safest stop which there is.

### Bullish Mitigation Block

When it comes to the bullish mitigation block then, what it looks like is the following. When it comes to the bullish mitigation block, what I want you to see is that the market forms a low right here. We see it then expand towards the upside, and notice that we still make one more leg towards the downside. Notice, however, that we create a higher low relative to this low. That's important because within the bullish breaker block, what you saw was that we saw the market create a lower low.

When the market then displaces above the last up close candle right here, we anticipate that this up close candle is likely going to function as a bottom price. So when the market retraces into that up close candle, that's a potential buying opportunity. Our stop loss gets placed below this low right here. That's the safest stop loss placement.

When it comes to both breakers and mitigation blocks, it's important to note that when market one creates a breaker, whilst market two creates a mitigation block, after we saw the market form the smart money reversal, it's very important to understand, that is SMT. And when that SMT is present, that's to us the confirmation that the low is in. And then we like to see the market displace towards the upside when this is all occurring during our time of interest.

### Bullish Fair Value Gap

When it comes to the fair value gap creation, then what I would like to see is that a bullish fair value gap looks like the following where you can see this sequence of three up close candles. When we pay attention to this sequence of three up close candles, what you can see is that between these three up close candles, you can see that there's a lack of sell side delivery. Meaning when you pay attention to candle one's high and candle three's low, you can see that there was a lack of sell side delivery, meaning there's a difference between this high and this low.

So when candle two expands higher, you must understand that there's no sell side which is being offered when the market expands above this high. Therefore, we are monitoring whether or not the market is going to retrace into the fair value gap, which is being established right here. We see that retracement taking place. And when that retracement occurs, that's a potential buying opportunity inside of a bullish fair value gap with our stop loss being placed below candle one's low.

Now again, it's possible that there will be multiple imbalances. If that is the case, we place our stop loss below the lowest imbalance. There are methods of recognizing breakaway gaps. However, for the sake of simplicity throughout you recognizing entry patterns right now, I'm not going to be discussing that because then this lecture is going to be on a completely different topic, which is balanced price ranges as such. And that is something which I'm saving for later within this Models series.

For now, simply focus on recognizing these fair value gaps. And when you recognize these fair value gaps and you become good at recognizing A to B, you will see that the retracement into a fair value gap will set up the next expansion in the anticipated direction.

## Bullish Chart Example

When we pay attention to a chart example, then what I would like you to do is I would like you to pause this lecture for a moment and I would like you to try and break down why the market expanded higher the way that it did. Now, if you want to look for entry patterns on the left side of the curve, meaning through this down move, you can also do so.

I hope that you paused the lecture because I'm now going to add my lipstick to the chart. Here you can see my annotations. And what I would like to show is that when you pay attention to these annotations is that I've outlined the buying opportunities which presented themselves.

Notice that we saw the market form a low right here around 10 o'clock. And notice that we saw the market reprice higher significantly. Do you see how quick these up close candles right here are? Do you see how we create this imbalance, this FVG, bullish fair value gap? Do you see how there was a lack of sell side delivery between candle one's high and candle three's low?

When price retraces into that imbalance, that's the first entry opportunity. That's our potential long entry. However, if you miss this opportunity or you want to wait for more confirmation, so to say, it doesn't feel right yet because you are more confident in trading the second entry opportunity. What I would like to show is that when the market expands away from this imbalance, you can be looking for the creation of another imbalance.

So here you can see that there's a tiny imbalance which got created. Do you see how the market retraced into that imbalance right here? But if you want to see more than simply that imbalance, look on the left side of the curve. Do you see this up close candle? This is your bullish breaker. The reason why I did not annotate it was because I wanted to purely focus on the imbalances with you within this example.

It's important to see that you recognize this is a bullish breaker: expansion lower, followed by a retracement higher. And we see the market expand towards the downside. Therefore, this is your bullish breaker. This up close candle can be extended to the right and pay attention to what range this imbalance formed in.

Now, one thing which is also important to notice is that when you pay attention to the left side of the curve, you can see that we have a tiny bearish fair value gap right here in which this high formed. When we see the market reprice above a high which formed inside of an imbalance and a new imbalance gets created on the right side of the curve, that's a market shift pattern. And when you start looking for that pattern, you will see that in every single key market reversal, that pattern is presented. If you do not see it on the timeframe that you're looking at, zoom into a lower timeframe because it will be there.

Now, when the market retraces into this imbalance, we see it expand higher once more. Do you see that there's a new imbalance which gets created right here? Do you see how the market retraces into that imbalance and it expands higher once more? And it creates a new imbalance right here.

Now, you often hear people say that it's hard to enter into positions. It's hard to find the trades. It's hard to see an opportunity. In front of you, you have four different entry opportunities, simply using fair value gaps. Think about that. By simply focusing on the fair value gaps, there were four entry opportunities inside of this example in front of you.

Do you understand that there's absolutely no reason for you to feel the fear of missing out or to feel like you've missed out on a move when you saw the market expand away from that first fair value gap and you're not in yet? Look, there will always be a new entry opportunity as long as the move that you're anticipating from point A to point B is still large enough, meaning as long as there's still enough room within that anticipated expansion. And that's what is crucial to understand.

Now, every single fair value gap which got created, every single entry had the same stop loss criteria. But if you would like to play it safe and you would like to basically give it a bit more room, whenever the market retraces into, for example, this fair value gap right here and you decide to take this entry, what you can do is you can say, "Okay, instead of taking it with a stop loss below this low right here, meaning the first candle's low, which set up the creation of this imbalance, you can play it safer by giving it a bit more room and placing a stop loss below the low which formed inside of this imbalance."

Because we never want to see lows that form inside of imbalances be taken out if the market displaced higher. The only scenario in which that would be allowed is if that low is the high of a higher timeframe imbalance. So for example, in front of you, you have a one minute timeframe—it could be that that low is the high of a five minute imbalance, only then would it be allowed to be taken out. But in general, you never want to see lows be taken out that formed inside of imbalances and that set up new displacement legs higher.

## Advanced Chart Example

Here we're at another chart example, and this one is a bit more tricky. However, I would like you to again pause this lecture, and I would like you to try and investigate where the bullish entry opportunities present themselves. If you would like to pay attention to the expansion towards the downside that's possible, but we're purely focused on the expansion towards the upside here.

I hope that you paused the lecture because I'm now going to add my lipstick to the chart. Here I've added my lipstick to the chart. And what you can see is that we saw the market expand towards the downside throughout the left side of the curve here. Do you see how the market was very slow and it was very gross delivery, where the market was just delivering lower in a very slow manner with a lot of back and forth going on right here? It's a high resistance liquidity run.

Whenever you see a high resistance liquidity run on the left side of the curve, you can anticipate that a low resistance liquidity run will take place on the right side of the curve. Now I am sure that a lot of people probably clicked away from this lecture early on because they thought, "Oh, this would simply be a simple lecture on entry patterns and whatever," and they're not picking up on those gems.

And the reason why I teach this way is because I'm not teaching simply weak minded people. I'm teaching to the people that are actually strong minded, that have the patience to sit through long lectures, that have the patience to investigate these boring things. Because you must understand that it's by investigating the simple schematics, the simple boring entry patterns that you will see how freaking often they repeat. And once you start seeing that again and again and again, you begin to realize, "Hey, they're actually algorithmic signatures." And when you recognize those algorithmic signatures within the right bigger picture from point A to point B, that is when you're able to say with great confidence, "This is what's going to happen next."

What I would like to show is that we see the market expand towards the downside. And eventually we see the market have one more push lower right here. Do you see how the market begins to accelerate towards the downside right here? Notice that we form a low and the market reprices higher. We see a bullish fair value gap getting created, but notice that the market does not retrace into this fair value gap. The reason why it doesn't have to is because on the left side of the curve, we have this bearish fair value gap, which we can extend to the right. Therefore, this is a breakaway gap since this is already a balanced price range.

Notice that the market takes out this high, which set up that final expansion leg lower. And when it comes to recognizing the final expansion leg lower, that's relative, meaning you could also argue that this is the high which set up the final expansion leg lower. Both are valid. This is the more aggressive way of recognizing a change in state of delivery. And this is the more safer way.

Notice that we see the market forming imbalance right here. And notice how the market consolidates around the imbalance. Why is the market consolidating? The reason why the market is consolidating right there is because long orders are being fulfilled right there. Surprises are being held inside of a tight range, time distortion has taken place, and inside of that consolidation, longs are being filled.

Notice how the market reprices into that high, which set up that final expansion leg lower. Notice how we repriced into this down close candle, but notice that the fair value gap below remains intact. We see the market expand towards the upside and notice that we see this very tiny fair value gap getting created right here. The market retraces into that fair value gap and the market then begins to consolidate once again.

What's happening right here? What's happening throughout this consolidation is again that long orders are being fulfilled. Why? Because they're waiting for the right time. And when the right time event represents itself, that's when you see the market begin expanding towards the upside with a lot of speed and velocity. And that is how you can recognize expansions before they occur. Small ranges turn into large ranges. And I know that this is not about entry patterns anymore then, but this is something to think about.

## Conclusion

And with that being said, I would like to thank you for watching this lecture. I want you to investigate everything which I've outlined to you. I would like you to go into your charts and try and investigate these entry patterns. I would like you to go out here and try and become very good at recognizing these entry patterns. Once you have confirmed that the smart money reversal is in, that's a key note which I would like to interject to you with.

And I promise to you that if you investigate these entry patterns in depth in the right order—meaning not simply going to the charts and looking for an entry pattern, now look for all the previous things which I've taught to you and only then look for the entry pattern—you'll be amazed.

Want to wish you good luck with your studies and look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture of this 2025 Models Series. Be safe!
