# Times of Interest - 2025 Model Series Lecture 08

Hello there, I hope you're doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on times of interest.

Before we begin with this lecture, I just want to apologize if the audio may sound a bit different than usual, and the reason why is because I'm currently traveling and I'm right now recording this lecture whilst being at the airport. However, I didn't want to delay the release of this lecture, and therefore I'm just going to record it now.

## Understanding Times of Interest

When it comes to times of interest, it's very important to understand the point: Times of interest allow you to know exactly when you are looking for specific algorithmic signatures in the delivery of price. This removes the hurdle of having to sit behind the charts all day through bad price action. Meaning, when we come to the charts, we must understand when we are looking for specific algorithmic signatures within the delivery of price. That is what I will show to you during this lecture.

First of all, you must understand that there are different methods of defining times of interest:

1. **SMT (Smart Money Technique)** - The reason why we're looking at SMT is because SMT is a crucial element when it comes to timing key market reversals
2. **Macros** - Specific 30-minute time windows where algorithmic signatures present themselves
3. **Delivery Profiles** - Patterns of accumulation, manipulation, and distribution

It's important to understand, however, that we haven't discussed the topics of SMT or delivery profiles yet within this Models series, and therefore I'm going to create separate topic lectures on these topics as well. But for now, we're simply going to focus on the basics when it comes to SMT and delivery profiles.

## Method 1: SMT (Smart Money Technique)

First of all, let's take a look at the concept of SMT. On the left right here, you can see a schematic where you can see two markets which are highly correlated. You can see that both markets are creating a reversal. However, when we're paying attention to this reversal, I would like you to see that the first market creates a lower low whilst the second market creates a higher low.

When we see this right here, whilst we are anticipating higher prices because the higher time frame institutional order flow is bullish—we're expecting the market to draw towards an objective above market price—we can anticipate that when we see this sign become present, that we're likely seeing that key reversal taking place.

On the right right here, you can see the opposing scenario where you can see that there are two highly correlated markets and we see a swing high formation, where I can see that market one takes out the previous swing high whilst the other market doesn't. And that right there is SMT which is present on the highs. We look for SMT when we're in a bearish market environment and we are anticipating the market to draw towards a price objective below market price and we have reached a higher time frame point of interest.

I'd like you to note that both forms of SMT are exactly the same but simply inversed. What I would like you to understand is that what you can see right here is that I've put boxes on the final fractals before the expansion took place. What I would like you to understand is that it's inside of this run lower followed by the expansion higher that a lower time frame market maker buy model is present. The same is of course taking place on the opposing side where we're seeing a market maker sell model inside that final run higher followed by the expansion towards the downside.

It's very important to understand that by seeing this SMT on a bigger time cycle, we can anticipate that on the lower time frames we're likely seeing these market maker models presenting themselves.

### Chart Example: Bearish SMT

When we pay attention to a chart example, then what I would like you to see is that on the left you can see the Nasdaq and on the right you can see ES. What I would like you to see is that the Nasdaq in this week consolidated and then we saw the market expand towards the upside. Notice that the market was drawn towards the previous high which was right here, and notice that the market did not take out this high—instead we create relatively equal highs.

If we pay attention to the right (on ES), what I would like you to see is that ES also consolidated and we saw ES expand towards the upside. Notice however that when this expansion occurred, ES took out the previous day high whilst NQ didn't. And that right there is SMT relative to the previous day high.

What I would like you to see then is the swing. As you can see, I've put a red box around this delivery, and what is important to notice is that when you pay attention to this delivery, you can see that this run up higher is the buy side of the curve and the run lower which follows is the sell side of the curve within a market maker sell model. Buy side to sell side.

When you start to understand that this SMT is really signaling to you that we're forming that swing high, you must then begin looking at the lower time frame price action to in fact confirm that a reversal is taking place.

### Chart Example: Bullish SMT

We're now going to be paying attention to a bullish scenario, and what I would like you to see is that on the left you can see Nasdaq again, on the right you can see ES. What you can see on the left is that Nasdaq expanded towards the downside and the market was drawn towards this Tuesday low. Notice the market reached this objective, took it out, and then reversed.

If we pay attention to ES however, what you can see is that ES also expanded towards the downside drawing towards Tuesday low, but notice that ES did not take out the low and instead ES created a higher low. I know these lows seem relatively equal, but Nasdaq took out the low whilst ES didn't, and therefore that is SMT which is present on the lows right there.

That SMT signals to us that we're likely going to see the market begin to reverse. What we will then do is we will drop into the lower time frames and confirm to us that we're in fact drawing towards buy-side liquidity next, because this is a market maker buy model where you can see the sell side of the curve followed by the buy side of the curve.

## Method 2: Macros

Now it's important to note that the reason why I want to touch on SMT first when it comes to times of interest is because a lot of people seem to believe that macros are the only way that you're able to basically try and time the markets. However, I want you to understand that macros are simply an introduction when it comes to time and its influence on delivery of price.

You must understand that we can utilize SMT to anticipate order flow changing already before it even occurs, and therefore whenever you see SMT relative to a bigger time cycle, that's your first sign of "All right, pay attention now." And that also basically tells you when you can anticipate a certain macro to deliver in a specific way, which we're going to touch on next.

### Understanding Macros

When we pay attention to macros, then what I want you to understand is that between every single hour's 45th minute and the next hour's 15th minute, what you can see is that there's a 30-minute interval in which algorithmic signatures as I'm teaching them to you will present themselves.

When you start investigating these specific time windows, your mouth is going to fall open because it's literally hidden in plain sight that within this specific 30-minute interval, you're going to see the same algorithmic signatures again and again.

However, this doesn't mean that I want you to look at the markets all day. I don't want you to do that. It's possible, don't get me wrong. However, you must understand that at the end of the day, your job is to filter out the cleanest opportunities, and you filter out those clean opportunities by looking at delivery profiles, by looking at bigger SMTs and all of that stuff.

### Key Macro Times (New York Time)

Therefore, as a general rule of thumb, these are the macros which I am personally paying attention to:

**London Session:**
- 2:45 to 3:15 AM macro
- 3:45 to 4:15 AM macro

**Morning Session:**
- 9:45 to 10:15 AM macro
- 10:45 to 11:15 AM macro

**Afternoon Session:**
- 1:45 to 2:15 PM macro
- 2:45 to 3:15 PM macro

As you can see, for all sessions that I've plotted here between the London to New York afternoon session, I have two macros which I'm paying attention to. Please note that I'm not paying attention to each one of these macros every single day, because I'm not doing that. I'm staying on the hourly chart and recognizing, "All right, when do I anticipate a swing high or swing low to form?" When I'm able to anticipate when a swing high or swing low forms, I'm able to then drop into the lower time frames and pay attention to these macros during the sessions to say, "Okay, this is when I'm going to engage, this is when I'm going to fill my positions, etc." Or "This is when I'm anticipating price to behave in a specific manner." And that's the power of these macros.

### Important Rule About Macros

Whenever a market reversal occurs outside of a macro window, we pay attention to the following: We pay attention to the next macro to anticipate the expansion to take place. Meaning, what you can see is that if at 5:18 AM we saw the market reverse right here, we should begin to displace towards the downside. Notice that when this displacement towards the downside occurs, we're immediately thinking to ourselves, "Okay, let's wait a bit until the next macro window so that we can then anticipate that we're likely going to see the next expansion occur."

This does not mean we cannot engage prior to the macro window. However, if you want to enter and immediately see the market expand in your favor, it's best to wait for the macro window.

## Method 3: Delivery Profiles

When it comes to delivery profiles, delivery profiles have the following rule: **You must focus on recognizing the manipulation cycle. Once you recognize the manipulation cycle, you can anticipate the distribution to follow.**

Meaning, your job is to recognize manipulation because once you recognize manipulation, you can anticipate distribution to always follow. And that is one of the most important insights which I would like to share with you.

One of the most important lessons which I had to learn the hard way was instead of just chasing price patterns for the sake of chasing price patterns (such as fair value gaps or breakers), my job became recognizing delivery profiles. Meaning, my job became simply focusing on recognizing manipulation, because always after manipulation, we see distribution unfold. That's a general rule of thumb.

And therefore, inside of manipulation, we can anticipate to see the signs of an SMR (smart money reversal) forming, because once those signs become present, that's when we can anticipate, "All right, we're now going to distribute towards the opposing side."

Focus on recognizing manipulation, guys, because by focusing on recognizing manipulation, trading the distribution becomes very straightforward.

### Bearish Delivery Profile

What it looks like within the charts is the following: When we're looking at a bearish example, we're looking for the market to consolidate. What's happening inside of this consolidation is that both buy-side and sell-side liquidity are being engineered. We eventually see the market open up for a new time cycle, and we see the market begin to open up and run higher, taking out the high of the consolidation. This right here is the manipulation taking place.

The moment that this manipulation takes place, I'm immediately thinking to myself, "Okay, who is now being trapped into believing higher prices are next?" Retail-minded traders. And therefore what I'm looking for is I'm looking for the signs that confirm to me we're rolling over, because once the signs become present that confirm to me that manipulation has ended, then I can anticipate that we're now going to distribute towards the downside.

### Bullish Delivery Profile

When we pay attention to a bullish example, then what I would like you to see is that the market is consolidating and it's going sideways. Inside this consolidation, both sell-side and buy-side liquidity are being engineered. Eventually you see the market open up for a new time cycle. Throughout this opening, what's taking place is that the market will seek to open up, drop lower, taking out sell-side liquidity engineered below the low of the consolidation. And this is manipulation which is taking place.

The moment that this manipulation takes place, we can anticipate that distribution will follow afterwards towards the upside. How do we confirm this? By looking at SMT and, for example, macros.

## Blending All Three Elements

Now I understand that when you're looking at these chart examples, you might be a bit confused and you might be looking at them and you might be like, "It can't be that simple, right? It can't be that straightforward." What if I told you it is? What if I told you can literally go into the charts and lose countless nights of sleep over investigating? And I promise you, especially when you start blending it with time cycles (which I've taught to you prior), when we look to blend these three elements to confirm to us that the time is right for the market to behave in a specific manner, we are going to be paying attention to:

1. **First of all, SMT** to confirm a swing low or swing high formation, because it's inside of that swing formation that a lower time frame market maker model is presenting itself
2. **Next, we're going to be paying attention to the macros** so that that reversal is taking place preferably during the macro window. If it doesn't during the macro window, we know that we must wait for the next macro window to anticipate that expansion take place
3. **Next, we're going to be paying attention to the delivery profiles** in the sense of AMD—we're looking for manipulation because once that manipulation has taken place, we know that distribution will have to follow afterwards always

## Summary

Understand that I discussed a lot during this lecture, and I totally understand if your heads are spinning right now, because time is one of the most fascinating concepts when it comes to looking at the markets through this algorithmic perspective. And it's also the most important because it's time, then price. It's not price first and then time. No, it's time, then price.

We're only looking at the markets at the right times, because when the right times are present, we can anticipate what the next delivery within price is going to be.

With that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that you found it insightful. I again apologize if the audio quality is different than usual because I'm recording this whilst being on the go—I'm recording this whilst being at the airport. So I hope everything got picked up clearly, and if not, I'm probably going to do a lot of editing afterwards and we're going to make sure that audio is as best as possible.

I'm going to discuss the topics of delivery profiles and SMT way more in depth in the future, and I'm also going to drop further hints when it comes to timing the market within more specific intervals, but that will all come later on in this Models series.

Thank you for watching this lecture all the way to the end, and I want to wish you good work in your studies. Be safe.
