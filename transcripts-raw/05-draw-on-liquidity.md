# Draw on Liquidity - 2025 Model Series Lecture 05

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series.

During this lecture, I will share with you insights on determining your draw on liquidity. Determining your draw on liquidity is the most crucial aspect when it comes to your trading, and therefore this is a very important lecture and I highly suggest you take notes.

If you did not watch the prior lectures of this Models series, I highly recommend you to watch those lectures first before watching this lecture. And the reason why is because I'm speaking to someone who has already gotten that foundational knowledge which I've provided prior. So with that being said, let us begin with this lecture.

## Trading Without a Destination

To begin this lecture, I would like to begin with the following quote:

**"Trading without a draw on liquidity is as if you're driving without a destination."**

Now I can already hear some of you think, "But hey, I like to drive without a destination. I like to just spin around in the world and just drive around my city and just enjoy driving my car." Yes, I understand that it's all fun and stuff, right? However, when it comes to trading, it's very important that you must note that you always need to have a destination when it comes to where the market is drawn towards.

Your draw on liquidity is so-called the end destination when you're driving within your car, meaning you have a certain destination that you're driving towards. And when the destination gets reached, you're done with driving your car. You need to view trading the same way, meaning you must view the markets through the perspective of point A to point B, where point B is the destination. And the destination is until when you anticipate that the market is going to draw into that direction.

Therefore, it's very important that you must understand that the draw on liquidity is as a magnet on price, meaning the markets are drawn to these draws on liquidity. And therefore, your job is to be able to determine where they are.

## Three Methods to Determine Draw on Liquidity

You can already read this correctly—there are multiple methods to determine the draw on liquidity. I will share all three methods with you today. However, what I would like you to understand is that you can pick the methods which suit you best. I highly suggest you to try and blend the methods and not rely on just one, because the precision is found in blending these three different methods with each other.

1. **Time Cycles** - We're utilizing the logic that I taught prior within this Models series to determine our draws on liquidity
2. **Key Levels** - Fixed price ranges based on quadrants
3. **PD Arrays** - Premium and discount arrays

When you try to blend all these three elements, it leads to high probability trading setups, as you will see during this lecture.

Now, please note that if you did not watch the prior lectures of this 2025 Models series, you're going to go into this lecture without any foundational knowledge about how to actually determine these three methods themselves. Do you now also understand why the first few lectures of this Models series were on these topics themselves?

## Method 1: Time Cycles

When we pay attention to time cycles, the logic of time cycles is the following: What you must see is that I have three boxes right here in front of you. Inside of these three boxes, there are time cycles which are taking place, meaning box one is time cycle one, box two is time cycle two, and box three is time cycle three.

Now, these boxes can represent whatever time cycle that you are looking at. In this case, I'm just going to refer to them as time cycles. This, by the way, shows you as well that you're able to apply this knowledge across all different time cycles, meaning whether you're a swing trader or whether you're an intraday trader or whether you're a long-term trader, it's all the same logic. It's all fractal.

Both time and price are fractal. The only difference is the duration of the time cycles that you're looking at. Therefore, what I want you to understand is that:

- Time cycle one right here determines how time cycle two will deliver
- Time cycle two will determine how time cycle three will deliver
- Throughout each new time cycle, we refer back to the high and low of the previous time cycle

The reactions to these levels tell us the story for what's likely going to happen next. During time cycle two, you refer to the high and low of time cycle one. During time cycle three, you refer to the high and low of time cycle two. That's a very important process which you must be applying when it comes to making your analysis about the marketplace.

### Fixed Time, Dynamic Price

Now, one thing which I would like to share with you before I dive into the next slide is that these time cycles are fixed, meaning they have a fixed starting point and a fixed end point. Where the highs and lows form during that window of time is dynamic.

For example, let's say that it is currently the month of March at the time of this recording. Throughout the month of March, a high and low will form. This high and low will be referred to throughout the next month. However, in one year, what will happen is that the high and low of March will be at different price levels than this month.

Therefore, what you see is that the start and end point is always fixed—it's the same. However, where the highs and lows form, that is what is adjustable. And that's a very important insight which you must understand because once we start looking at the key levels as well, you will begin to see that those are fixed and the time-based liquidity pools are dynamic.

### Purge and Revert

When we pay attention to utilizing time cycles for draws on liquidity, my main focus is on determining whether or not the purge and revert is taking place.

A purge and revert is basically the market taking out (in a bullish example) a previous cycle low, meaning this red line right here is the previous cycle low. We open low into that, take out the sell-side liquidity resting below this low, then we see the signs present of a smart money reversal having taken place, then we see the market draw towards the upside. The moment that the displacement higher takes place, we can immediately say, "All right, the first draw on liquidity is going to be the previous cycle high," which is this buy-side liquidity pool.

If we pay attention to the bearish example, it's the same logic but inversed, where you see that the market opens up a new time cycle, runs the previous cycle high, see the signs of a smart money reversal having taken place, and then we see the market begin to expand towards the downside. Displacement lower takes place. When this displacement lower takes place, my eyes immediately run towards the previous cycle low, because below that low, sell-side liquidity has been engineered throughout that previous time cycle.

### Sweeping vs. Purging

Whenever the market takes out a time-based liquidity pool (so in this case, the AM low), we call that the sweeping of liquidity which has taken place. The moment that we see the market form a low below that time-based liquidity pool and we see it displace higher, from that moment in time we call it a purge on liquidity. 

Why? Because then we see that smart money has bought below the morning session's low, below the previous time cycle low. And now we can anticipate that the buy program is going to unfold. And that's a very important definition which I want you to understand—it's the difference between sweeping liquidity and purging liquidity:

- **Sweeping liquidity** is simply the market taking out a liquidity pool
- **Purging liquidity** is the market showing the willingness to form a new low below that previous cycle low to then distribute towards the upside

So purging is a sign of manipulation taking place. Whenever you recognize that manipulation is taking place and you see a purge on liquidity, you can anticipate that distribution is likely going to take place soon next.

## Method 2: Key Levels

The next method of determining the draws on liquidity is by using key levels. When it comes to key levels, the levels which I'm referring to are the levels which were introduced throughout the 2024 Models series. These levels are based upon quadrants, meaning:

- First quadrant: 0 to 25
- Second quadrant: 25 to 50  
- Third quadrant: 50 to 75
- Fourth quadrant: 75 to 100

Now as outlined prior throughout the price cycles lecture, what is very important to note is that you must be able to see what the sequence is currently that price is following, meaning just like there's a sequence in time, there's also a sequence in price.

And that means what IPDA is doing is that it's referring to these reference points as reference points to simply say, "Okay, we're still in a buy program. We're still in a buy program. We're still in a buy program." Why? Because until that bigger draw on liquidity is reached (meaning that more important price level, that bigger price level), that is when you can anticipate every single expansion higher to be followed by retracement lower to continue higher.

### Chart Example: Nasdaq

When we pay attention to a chart example right here, what you can see is that we are looking at the Nasdaq chart. What you can see is that I've annotated the 21,000 price level right here, the 20,500, and the 20,000 price level.

Throughout this week, what I outlined to you was the following: What I outlined to you was that as long as the market would not displace above the 21,000 price level, I would anticipate the market to draw lower. Why did I outline that? The reason why is due to the following:

When you pay attention to this delivery on the left, what I would like you to see is that the market displaced through that 21,000 price level and an FVG was created right here. As long as the market does not displace above this FVG, I anticipate that what will happen is that IPDA is going to refer to the next dealing range.

What is the next dealing range? From 21,000 to 20,000. Inside of that range, equilibrium (50% of that range) is right here—20,500. Meaning, what I can anticipate is that around the 20,500 price level, we're likely going to see some form of consolidation.

Notice how the market wicked multiple times below that orange line, which represents equilibrium of that bigger range. But notice how it took a long time before it finally displaced through it and reached that 20,000 price level. That shows to you that the reaction to equilibrium can be monitored whenever a new range gets entered.

### Fixed Ranges, Fractal Application

Now understand that some of you might be looking at this example and might be thinking to yourself, "But hey, does that mean we're only using price ranges of 1000 points?" No, we can also use a price range of 100 points, for example. And that is a smaller price range. However:

- When you're looking at bigger price swings, you must of course use bigger ranges
- When you're looking at smaller price swings, you must be paying attention to smaller ranges

So what I'm outlining to you now as well is how price is fractal, because IPDA follows the same logic on the higher timeframes as it does on the lower timeframes. Just like I outlined that the time cycles are fractal, where we can apply the same logic over and over again but across different time cycles (both smaller time cycles and bigger time cycles), the same applies to these price ranges, where we can apply the same logic on a smaller range as we do on the bigger range.

## Method 3: PD Arrays

When we pay attention to PD arrays as draws on liquidity, what's important to understand is that these arrays form in a sequence during buy and sell programs. The creation of imbalances, breakers, and mitigation blocks all provide potential targets for price.

During this lecture, I will not explain the PD arrays in detail, as they have already been explained throughout the previous lecture. However, what I would like you to see is that I'm blending the three different elements of determining your draw on liquidity into one.

## Blending All Three Methods

What you can see right here in the following schematic is that I've blended both the time cycles and the key levels. And next to that, I've blended the PD arrays with this logic as well, meaning I'm adding all three elements to each other.

First of all, it's important to note that we're looking at a buy program, meaning we're looking at a bullish example. What we can see is that the market reached our range high right here, and we saw the market consolidate. We saw the market drop towards the downside, and we saw displacement lower. We see a blue box get plotted right here, which represents a bearish fair value gap (an FVG). Market retraces, and we see another FVG get created.

Notice that at this moment in time, a new time cycle is opening. This time cycle opens because this vertical line is plotted right here. The market retraces, and we see it retrace back into that blue box, into that FVG. An expansion leg lower occurs, and the market retraces and expands lower one more time.

Notice that we see the market expand towards the range low, utilizing the key levels, and we see the market retrace. Eventually, we see the market have one more drop towards the downside right here, taking out sell-side liquidity resting below this low, trading below the key level, and we then see the smart money reversal taking place.

From this moment in time, what we can say is that the sell side of the curve is completed, and now we can anticipate the buy side of the curve to take place.

### Focus on Recognizing Reversals

This is what your focus has to be on—becoming very good at recognizing reversals. When you become very good at recognizing smart money reversals, trading the right side of the curve will be far more straightforward. Why? Because the right side of the curve is a reflection of the left side of the curve. So when you know that the program is changing from sell to buy program, all that there's left to do is paying attention to the left side of the curve and utilizing that to gauge the order flow on the right side of the curve.

## Important Insights

### The Market Works in Programs

What I want you to understand is that IPDA is following a certain logic. Whether we're in a buy program or sell program determines everything about how price will deliver. Your job is to recognize when the program changes and where price is being drawn towards.

### Levels Are Guidelines, Not Absolutes

When it comes to these key levels, you're not going to see the absolute highs and lows always form at these levels. Sometimes what will happen is that the market will drop just below the level and then form the smart money reversal, or it will run just above the level and then form the smart money reversal. These levels are meant to gauge the order flow, meaning they are meant to provide you with structure when it comes to price. Your job is to recognize when the reversals are taking place, but please keep in mind that the reversals can take place around the levels, meaning not exactly at them.

### The Importance of Investigation

I know that some of you never pause these lectures and you're probably watching this series as if it's your favorite Netflix series, and yet you're surprised that you don't understand the full logic which I'm outlining to you. You must investigate in great detail what I'm outlining to you. This doesn't come overnight. It's not like you are able to just watch the lecture and boom, there it clicks. No, it's going to take a lot of work and a lot of effort for you to be able to recognize these algorithmic signatures.

However, once you're able to see this, you will never be able to unsee this, and that's what I want you to keep in mind no matter what. Will it be hard to understand this logic? Will it be challenging to get to this level of understanding? Absolutely. You're going to be faced with hardships. You're going to be faced with moments in your journey where you're going to feel like throwing in the towel, but it's your job to keep on moving forward no matter what. It's your job to keep on investigating.

## Homework Assignment

As a homework assignment, I want to simply ask you to get as much chart time as possible. Try and get in as many chart examples as possible of this logic being applied because this is what your focus should be on now. We're going to dive into the details way down the line, but for now focus on this right here.

What I suggest you to do to investigate what I've outlined during this lecture is:

1. Apply these time cycles on your charts. You can utilize the time cycles indicator for that.
2. Apply the price ranges on your chart. You can utilize the advanced price ranges indicator for that.

Both are available on the mentorship platform, meaning as a student of mine, you can get access to these indicators. You can add them to your TradingView and they will make the whole backtesting aspect way easier for you.

And what I suggest you to do is then to start blending the two elements so that you're able to see, "Okay, where are the levels based upon the indicators?" It's doing that calculation for you, so it saves you a little time. And next, where are the time cycles meeting? Where are the start and end of these time windows?

Once you start paying attention to both time cycles and these ranges, I promise to you that you're going to see a completely different side of the markets that you have never seen before. Once you start adding the PD arrays to that as well, you will see that determining the draw on liquidity is a very straightforward process.

I'm not saying it's easy. I'm not saying that you're going to get it right away. But I do promise that this is the only true way to come to objectivity when it comes to your analysis and perception behind the charts.

With that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that you found this insightful. Thank you for watching this lecture all the way to the end. I look forward to speaking to you soon again in the next episode. Be safe.
