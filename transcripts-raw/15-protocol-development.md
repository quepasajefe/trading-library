# Protocol Development - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. During this lecture we will be discussing protocol development. This lecture is going to be in a completely different style than the prior lectures of this series, and the reason being is because I'm going to take you with me into a free program which I like to use called Miro.com. 

Miro.com is a platform which you can use in order to create flowcharts, and the reason why I wanted to create this lecture for this Models series is because I understand that many of you have gone through the lectures of the Models series and have probably not yet created your own protocol as a result of that. Therefore, I'm going to guide you into developing your own protocol and how I would suggest you to begin looking at all of the lectures which are released for this Models series.

## The Structure of Learning

Now, what's important to note is that when we began the Models series, I began focusing on first of all discussing individual concepts such as price cycles, time cycles and PD arrays. After these individual concepts were discussed, I began diving deeper into the protocol itself where it begins with higher timeframe institutional order flow and where we're now at delivery profiles.

Now, what's important to note is that when it comes to the overall structure which I utilize within the release of this content, I would like you to understand that everything was released at exactly the right moment in time, meaning I planned out in advance what moment I wanted to release and discuss specific topics, and therefore I'm going to show you more behind this structure.

Now, understand that many of you have probably not recognized this structure because you were probably treating each lecture as if it was a new individual lecture. However, everything is connected and that is something which I would like you to begin seeing. So what I will be sharing with you is a flowchart example of what your protocol can look like moving forward.

It's important to note that when we eventually look at protocol development from a personal perspective, every single trader is going to have his own protocol, meaning every single trader is going to create his own variation of what I'm about to share with you. But it's important to note that the foundation should always remain similar to what I'm about to share.

## Getting Started with Miro

Now, when you go to Miro.com, what you can do is you can just create an account for free and you can log in with your email. Once you have created your account with Miro, you can go to a flowchart and you can open up a new board. Now, when we pay attention to a new board, what I would like to show is that I've outlined right here the reversal sequence.

The way that I've created this reversal sequence is by utilizing the following: utilizing the shapes tool right here and squares. Once you put a square on the screen, what you can do is you can type in that and you can give it the background color, etc. But for the sake of simplicity, I've already did all of that. So I'm just going to walk you through what I've put in front of you.

## The Reversal Sequence - Core of Everything

Here we can see the reversal sequence, and the reversal sequence is basically the core of everything which I've been discussing throughout the Models series. And the reason why this reversal sequence is important is because I want you to understand that in advance of every single market reversal, the same steps always apply. And that's the beauty of the model as I'm teaching it to you.

This is the core of IPDA. This is literally what IPDA is doing all the time. And this is fractal, meaning it applies on all different timeframes. So what's important to note is that the reversal sequence looks like the following where you can see that it begins with:

### 1. Higher Timeframe Institutional Order Flow (HTF IOF)

This right here is very important. If you are unable to define the higher timeframe institutional order flow, you cannot continue moving forward, meaning your focus must be first on determining the higher timeframe institutional order flow.

### 2. Draw on Liquidity (DOL)

After the order flow has been established, the next step is determining the draw on liquidity. This is the price level that IPDA is drawn towards like a magnet, so to say. It's going to keep on repricing until that level has been met. This is our DOL.

### 3. Point of Interest (POI)

After we established our DOL, the next step is recognizing a point of interest. And the reason why it's important to understand that DOL comes prior to POIs is due to the following: Whenever you come to the charts, it's not simply "oh, we take out the previous cycle low and therefore the market should reverse." No, there has to be a higher timeframe bullish order flow which is in play, and you must have already determined a draw on liquidity above market price. Only then can you look at a point of interest in the sense of, "Okay, I'm going to be looking for a reversal to originate from here."

And the reason why it's important to understand is due to the following. What I would like you to understand is that whenever we come to the charts, our job is on determining, okay, let's say that the higher timeframe institutional order flow is bullish and we're anticipating price to draw towards, for example, an old high. This is our DOL.

What we then anticipate for the next time cycle is the following: Looking for the market to open up, drop lower. Why is it important that we drop lower? Because it's inside of this move lower that retail is being trapped into believing that lower prices are next. Usually this drop is rather quick and sudden. And the reason why it has to be quick and sudden is because it's inside of that quick and sudden repricing lower that manipulation takes place.

That drop lower induces emotions of fear. It induces the thoughts of, "Oh, the market is going to continue dropping, it's going to continue expanding towards the downside." But it's exactly in that fear which is being established that smart money is beginning to position themselves long.

Until when are we going to drop? We are likely going to drop until our POI has been met, meaning what you can look for is the following: You can look for open lower of a new time cycle into your point of interest, but only after you establish that the higher timeframe order flow is bullish and you establish the draw on liquidity. This is why POI comes after the DOL, because once the POI has been met, we can anticipate that price is likely going to expand towards the DOL.

### The Bearish Schematic

Now the opposing schematic will of course be true for bearish order flow where you can see that the market is repricing towards the downside on the higher timeframes. You're bearish and therefore you look for a draw on liquidity below market price. So what are we going to be looking for for the next time cycle? We're going to be looking for the next time cycle to open up, run higher.

It's in this run higher that manipulation has taken place, and usually this run higher is rather quick with big green candles. Why is this important? Because those big green candles induce retail into believing that price is likely going to continue expanding forever, that price is likely going to continue running, and it induces feelings of fear of missing out. So everyone is going to try and buy it as the market is running up higher like this.

But this is exactly in that manipulation that smart money is positioning themselves short, and once the POI has been met, we can anticipate that the market is likely going to reverse to draw towards the downside.

Now I hope that by me drawing these schematics in real time that you're able to experience the light bulb moments, because these are the fundamental concepts which are very important to understand.

If you do not understand what I've just drawn up when it comes to higher timeframe institutional order flow, DOL and POI, I highly suggest you to go back to the respective lectures within the Models series and study them, because what I'm going to do during this protocol development lecture is I'm going to simplify everything and bring it back to the core.

And the reason why this is important is because you want to be able to basically fit your whole model, your whole protocol on a business card. And the way you do that is by having these fundamental concepts well understood within your mind and that you can simply look at a schematic like this and say, "Okay, yes, this is the beginning of the reversal sequence playing out right here," because this is what our focus is on: recognizing reversals. And that's the whole model as I'm teaching it to you throughout this Models series.

Now it is definitely possible to also be looking for continuation trades. However, when it comes to continuation trades, continuation trades are merely a result of understanding that price has yet to reach a higher timeframe DOL. So continuation trades will present themselves on the lower timeframes throughout this run lower within the sell program or throughout this run higher within the buy program on the fractal and smaller time cycles.

### 4. Time of Interest (TOI)

Now after the reversal sequence has been established from the higher timeframe institutional order flow to the POI, the next step is paying attention to the time of interest, the SMT and the CSD. So these are basically the fundamental concepts from a basically simplified perspective. However, each one of these individual steps has its own sub-steps. It has its own smaller steps which we can pay attention to, and those are going to be shared with you shortly.

However, before we dive into those, I would like you to understand that this sequence literally means that every single step leads to the next step. If you're unable to define, for example, what your point of interest is, you're not going to say, "Hey, you know what, I'm going to continue to the time of interest and I'm going to continue looking for a trade." No, the whole sequence is built around every single step being well defined, every single step being predefined.

And therefore, if you do not see any of these steps—doesn't matter if you can't see the POI, doesn't matter if you can't see the DOL, doesn't matter if you can't see the SMT or the CSD—if any of these steps is missing, you are not going to find yourself in the right environment. Therefore, I want you to start becoming process oriented in this sense.

And the way that I always suggest that people study this is through the following: I suggest you to have a protocol defined according to this reversal sequence and then make sure that you have it on another screen or maybe you can print it out and put it on your desk. But whenever you come to the charts, I would like you to start thinking in the sense of, "Okay, step one, step two, step three, step four, step five, step six." And it's exactly in that order that you're going to be able to align yourself with what is likely going to happen next.

Because once this whole sequence is complete, what's likely going to happen next? We're likely going to see a reversal taking place and we're likely going to see the right side of the curve be developed.

So I hope that this has clicked for you. And if you need some more time to process everything which I'm sharing with you so far, please pause the lecture right now because I'm going to continue shortly.

But before we continue, I would also like you to look at this reversal sequence and look at all of these bigger blocks, all of these bigger steps, and I would like you to try and define as best as you can for each individual step: How can you determine the higher timeframe IOF? How can you determine the DOL? How can you determine the POI? How can you determine the time of interest? How can you determine SMT? And how can you determine CSD?

Because by practicing your recognition of being able to define each one of these individual steps and comparing that to what I'm about to share with you, you're able to test whether or not you understood the majority of what I've discussed throughout this Models series.

## The Sub-Steps of the Reversal Sequence

Now with that being said, I'm going to move lower towards the sub-steps as well. So here you can see the reversal sequence, but then with the sub-steps as well.

### Higher Timeframe Institutional Order Flow Sub-Steps

And what I would like you to see is that the higher timeframe institutional order flow begins with the following. First of all, we must define whether or not there's a market maker sell model or market maker buy model in play, meaning is price right now in a sell program or in a buy program on the highest possible timeframes. And we're speaking about monthly delivery now, we're speaking about the weekly delivery now, we're speaking about daily delivery now.

Once you're able to define on the higher timeframes where price is drawn towards, whether it is for example a sell program or buy program, this is directional higher timeframe institutional order flow. That's when we move on.

However, there's a very important role which comes to mind as well when it comes to higher timeframe IOF establishment. And that is narrative, meaning you must be able to define why. Why should price expand lower or why should price expand higher? What's the overall logic behind that? Why would this make sense? What are the masses led to believe right now? What is everyone else thinking? But if the charts tell you a completely different story, that's when you know that you have a high probability trade setup forming, which is now being established because you know that the masses are wrong.

And that's a level of confidence which will be developed over time as you gain more experience. Right now, you probably don't have that confidence just yet. Some of you do. I know that because some of you are absolutely crushing it already. But I know that for the majority of traders, they are too new when it comes to looking at these concepts. And therefore, it will require more time and effort for you to get to that level of confidence.

But that will come in due time. Submit to time. Don't try to rush the process. Let's just aim for let's say six to 12 months. And within six to 12 months, I believe that if you study everything which I'm outlining to you during this lecture and that I've outlined to you throughout the whole Models series, I'm 100% confident that you are going to achieve that level of confidence because it doesn't change. Like this remains always the same.

And I think that's a very beautiful experience for you to start feeling that way for the first time. I remember what it felt like for me when I began realizing that this is all that IPDA does all the time. And my job is recognizing the reversal sequence. Because when I can recognize the reversal sequence, that's when I can anticipate the right side of the curve. And that is what I do within my reviews. That is what I do within all of the analysis which I share with you. That's what I do with all my trades. Everything is based around the reversal sequence, recognizing reversals.

### Draw on Liquidity Selection Sub-Steps

Now, once we have established the higher timeframe IOF, the basically next step is determining draw on liquidity. Now, when it comes to draw on liquidity selection, there are a variety of tools which we can utilize to determine the draw on liquidity:

1. **PDH and PDL** - And what PDH and PDL means is the use of time cycles. And when it comes to draw on liquidity selection, it's important to note that there are multiple draws on liquidity, but you move from the bigger draw on liquidity to the smaller draw on liquidity. Meaning, once you have defined, for example, that the higher timeframe institutional order flow is bullish, you're going to be looking for a draw on liquidity above market price for the upcoming month, if not weeks or days. Once you have established that bigger draw on liquidity, you can utilize smaller time cycles to frame draws on liquidity throughout the days, meaning you can be using a previous session high, or you can be using a previous 90-minute cycle high, or even previous 30-minute cycle high, depends on how big the trades are which you want to target.

2. **Old PD Arrays** - You can be thinking of old imbalanced price ranges, old imbalances, you name it. As long as you have a higher timeframe old PD array which you see that IPDA has yet to reprice into, and you can pair it with a previous cycle high, then that is a beautiful signature, because that shows that liquidity has been engineered in advance of that higher timeframe premium array.

3. **Key Levels** - When it comes to key levels, you can be monitoring the reactions to the ranges as I've been teaching them to you throughout this 2025 Models series. Pay attention to the big figures, and pay attention to whether or not there are key arrays which have formed inside of those levels or around them, and pay attention to whether or not liquidity has been engineered in advance of them, because when you see liquidity in advance of a key level, it's a beautiful sign.

4. **Opening Prices** - And I'm not referring to opening prices in the sense of just midnight openings, so daily openings or whatever. No, I'm referring to bigger time cycle openings. So we're speaking about monthly openings, then we're speaking about quarterly openings, yearly openings, etc. Because once you start paying attention to those bigger time cycles, their opening prices, you're able to have a premium and discount filter, where above the specific opening, you're going to be looking for shorting opportunities if price is range bound, and below that open, we're going to be looking for buying opportunities if price is range bound, or if we're going to trend where manipulation has taken place—manipulation below the opening price, form a swing low, and then expand towards the upside. But keep in mind that we can also use opening prices to determine draw on liquidity, because price will seek to revisit, for example, a yearly open a lot. Why? Because it is a crucial level for the whole yearly delivery.

### Point of Interest Selection Sub-Steps

When we then pay attention to point of interest selection, what you can see is that the point of interest is actually exactly the same four steps as it is for the draw on liquidity selection. That's a fairly important insight which I'm sharing with you, and this comes back to the concept which I've been discussing a lot lately, and that's the following:

A to B, the B gets met and turns into a new A to B. And once the B gets met, a new A to B gets established. And this process is infinite, and this is also why what you see taking place throughout the days is that where some of you enter positions and eventually exit those positions, others will look to get into new trades. And this is what I refer to when I say, "Hey, we're playing ping pong on these markets," where my exit could be your entry, and your exit could be my entry.

And that's what I mean when I say A to B, A to B, A to B, A to B. Meaning all it is about is the following: It's about recognizing A to B, the price swing from inception to terminus, and once your terminus has been met, that's when your idea is done, but that terminus could be someone else's inception. And that's a beautiful sign to see.

Now I don't want you to think that you should be trading all directions all the time, meaning you shouldn't be looking for shorts to longs or longs to shorts or whatever when you're completely new. That will take a lot of experience, but in the future, I believe that if you investigate everything which I'm outlining to you during this lecture, but also throughout this whole Models series, I believe that you will be able to anticipate when the reversals are going to take place.

And it's all about being content with enough at the end of the day, guys. Like don't think that you should be living to trade. I believe that the right mindset to have is that we're trading to live, meaning once we make our money, we're done. We don't care anymore. Because else what will happen is that you're trying to do too much, and it's not about doing more, it's about doing less actually.

So therefore, focus on the reversal sequence from a perspective of the move which makes the most logical sense to you. And the only way to define it is by paying attention to the bigger timeframes, paying attention to, "Okay, where are the higher timeframe swings forming?" And once the higher timeframe swing is forming, whether it be a swing high or a swing low, that is when we know, "Okay, low resistance liquidity run is likely going to follow next." Now we can look in and focus.

Now, for the point of interest selection, what's important to note is that we pay attention to the opposing PDH or PDL as we did for a draw on liquidity, meaning if we are bullish and we're looking for higher prices, we are targeting a previous cycle high. But that means our point of interest becomes a previous cycle low. Why? Because we need to see sell side liquidity be taken out before the market can reverse. Why? Because we move from sell side to buy side, buy side to sell side.

Now, what I love to see is sell side liquidity be engineered in advance of an old PD array, in advance of a discount array in the case of bullishness. Next, I love to see a key level being around that array. And if I see price open up, drop lower below an opening price, and I see that clear manipulation taking place—think back to the schematics which I've outlined right here, where I mentioned that the beginning of this run right here is the beginning of a new time cycle. You should begin to smile because this is how you can see that everything is connected.

### Time of Interest Sub-Steps

Now, once we have defined a point of interest, what we'll be waiting for is we'll be waiting for a time of interest. And when it comes to time of interest, there are two methods of looking at times of interest. There are way more, but to keep it simple for you throughout this foundational protocol, so to say, we are going to be paying attention to:

1. **The macro from XX:45 to XX:15**
2. **Manipulation cycles**

Now, the macros themselves are pretty straightforward. I've already discussed them in depth throughout this Models series. So if you do not understand them yet, I highly suggest you to go back to those lectures and study the importance of macros.

However, manipulation cycles are something which for the majority of you probably doesn't click as much yet. And the reason being is because you probably think that the manipulation cycle is purely the respective 90-minute cycle within each session. So for example, within London, AM or PM. And that's correct. However, the time cycles shift, meaning manipulation cycles shift throughout each trading day. Not every single day the low is going to form between 8:30 to 10:00, for example. It doesn't happen. Why not? Because if it would happen that way, then it would be obvious to the masses that IPDA, or that there are entities out there, that are manipulating always between 8:30 to 10:00. And that is of course not possible because we need that counterparty.

So it must seem random, so to say, to the masses. But it's exactly in that understanding that your focus has to be on, "Okay, what is the delivery profile for the day?" And the way we define what the delivery profile for the day is, is by paying attention to manipulation cycles.

So I'm boxing it in. Right now, this is where your focus has to be: Recognize manipulation, because once you recognize manipulation, you can anticipate distribution. Now I can already hear you think, "Zeussy, how can I recognize manipulation? How can I recognize that price is manipulating?" And it comes back to that same foundational schematic: Open low into a point of interest after you have established DOL and your higher timeframe institutional order flow.

The moment that a new time cycle opens up and manipulates into your point of interest, that is when we can say, "Okay, this cycle is manipulating. So we're either going to distribute heading into the end of this cycle, or we're going to distribute heading into the next cycle." And that is how you recognize manipulation cycles.

### SMT (Smart Money Divergence) Sub-Steps

Then the next step is confirming this manipulation cycle, confirming that we're forming a swing low or swing high. The way we do that is by paying attention to SMT. Why SMT? Because SMT stands for smart money divergence. Keep that in mind. SMT literally shows to you that there's a manipulation leg which is likely coming to an end now.

How can we look at SMT? Well, I've taught you three different forms of SMT besides some other forms of SMT. However, for this foundational protocol, I've decided to purely focus on the three most important forms of SMT. And those are:

1. **Big time cycle SMT** - So think of SMT relative to bigger time cycles
2. **Smaller time cycle SMT** - Inside of the absolute reversal right here
3. **Double SMT** - Where you have both forms of SMT present

So it's important to note that the SMT is relative to the duration of the analysis which you're making. Look, if you're making an analysis for the upcoming quarter, for the upcoming three months, right? You're not going to be looking at a one minute SMT and going to be saying, "Okay, this confirms the move for the quarter." No, it doesn't work that way. You'd be more inclined to utilize a weekly SMT or monthly SMT, maybe even daily to be fair.

But when you pay attention to, for example, an analysis for today or even the session, then you can utilize, for example, a 90-minute cycle SMT, 30 minutes, 10 minutes, maybe even three-minute cycle SMT to confirm the low of that smaller time cycle.

Now, it's important to note is that SMT by itself means absolutely nothing. So do you see where that statement comes from? SMT only holds any significance after all of these prior four steps are checked, meaning after all of these prior four steps are in play. That is also why within the Models series, I didn't release the SMT lectures at the beginning of the series. Look, I've outlined literally a sequence. So I hope for those of you that have gone through my Models series up until this point that you have studied it in depth and that you've paid attention to these smaller details because it's literally a sequence in which I've been explaining everything to you because this is the sequence of IPDA.

And I understand that for some of you, you've probably been not putting in the work. You've probably just watched through the series and you're now at this lecture and you're like, "Damn, I don't understand it yet." Look, if that is the case, you rushed through it. That's the easiest way to say it. You rushed through it and you need to take accountability for that. And the way that you're going to make sure that you get to that right level of understanding is by going back to the lectures, doing the homework assignments, looking in the charts for what I'm explaining to you, and then simply diving deep and beginning to see the repetition because it's the same process all the time based around time and price.

### CSD (Change in State of Delivery) Sub-Steps

Now, the final step which you're going to be paying attention to is CSD, change in the state of delivery. Now, for CSD, I've defined three different ways that you can be looking at CSD:

1. **Imbalances displacement through** - Meaning imagine that there is, for example, a reversal which has taken place on the upside and you have imbalances which formed right here on the left side of the curve. You have imbalances which formed here and you have imbalances which formed here. These are FVGs. These FVGs, these premium imbalances, should function as resistance in price to continue lower if the underlying order flow is going to remain bearish. However, why are we going to be paying attention to these imbalances now? Because all of the prior steps of the reversal sequence are in play which signal to us that the swing low is in the making. Therefore, we are not looking at these FVGs to short off to go market short again, so to say. No, we're anticipating that price is going to rip through them, and once price runs through that sequence of imbalances which reach our point of interest right here, that's the first sign that the underlying order flow is changing. What we can then anticipate is that price is likely going to retrace, utilize that sequence of imbalances as support in price and reprice higher. If price displaces through the next sequence of imbalances—and when I say sequence of imbalances, I say multiple imbalances, but it can also just be one. Depends on the environment and how quick the market has been moving—but if price displaces through those imbalances on the left side of the curve, that's a sign to you that the underlying order flow is changing from sell to buy program. So what we can anticipate is that price is likely going to retrace and expand towards the upside.

2. **The creation of opposing imbalances** - Because as price is repricing higher, what we will be monitoring is new imbalances to form. The reason why is because these imbalances are showing to us that there's a certain urgency for the market to reprice higher. It's showing to us that there's urgency for the market to displace, to run. That's the function of an imbalance. An imbalance shows to you speed—now it has to run. That's why there's no time for a retracement to take place to see immediate rebalance. No, instead the market just continues running and at the later moment in time it will retrace to reprice back into that inefficiency.

3. **Breaker or mitigation block formation** - And the reason why a breaker or mitigation block formation is crucial is because a breaker or mitigation block formation is required in order for a swing high or swing low to form, meaning every single swing formation either has a breaker or a mitigation block. There are no swings which form in any different shape or form and that's something which I would like you to investigate. I've already mentioned this prior throughout the series but if you did not investigate this yet, do so. So, do you understand why it is crucial that you focus on recognizing swing highs or swing lows formations through the lens of breakers and mitigation blocks? In my example, this is your bullish breaker of course right here.

Now, what's important to note is that in front of you I've drawn up the reversal sequence with an example and do you see how every single step is leading to the next step? That right there is the most important takeaway which I want you to have from this schematic right here because this is literally the foundation of the protocol as I suggest you to begin working with.

You can define and refine your own variables if you would like to—for example only pay attention to PDH and PDL in combination with for example PD arrays, or you can be looking at purely breaker and mitigation block formations. You can be purely looking at the macros and you only want to trade those. Doesn't matter. This is the core and around that core you will be able to define your own process, your own protocol.

## Beyond the Technicals

Now, this is purely the technicals, meaning this is the reversal sequence from a technical perspective. The next step is paying attention to risk management.

### Risk Management

For risk management, I highly suggest you to watch my risk management lecture in which I discuss this topic, and the reason being is because risk management is again something which is very personal, meaning some of you might be very aggressive when it comes to risk management whilst others might be very conservative where you're trying to slowly grow the equity. And that is based around personality, based around overall equity capital in your possession, etc.

However, define risk management rules. Define for yourself how much you are going to be risking on any given idea, how much you are going to be aiming to make, how you're going to handle drawdown, how you're going to manage your capital, etc. Define these elements, write them down. Don't be lazy, don't be ignorant and think to yourself "I know what I... I don't have to do this" or whatever.

Look, I'm literally showing to you how to create your own protocol, and the protocol isn't just the reversal sequence, it isn't just technical. No, it's more than that. It's about how you handle risk, but it's also about operator management.

### Operator Management

Now, operator management is a topic which I've been discussing more and more throughout the 2025 mentorship with sit-down lectures, with more psychological rants, etc., and this is something which I'm going to be releasing more and more in the future. But the reason why operator management plays a crucial role when it comes to everything which I'm outlining to you now is because at the end of the day, this is purely the technicals, meaning this is the reversal sequence, this is IPDA. And if you don't believe me yet, it's because you haven't studied enough yet.

However, I know that some of you have studied enough and I've been receiving great messages, absolutely phenomenal when I see those support messages or when I receive those DMs or those emails, etc. And it makes me smile to see you get those payouts, to see you get the profit on those live accounts, etc. And please keep in mind I'm never going to be telling you to go out there and trade based on the information which I'm providing to you. Everything which I'm sharing right here for you is purely for educational purposes. I'm not a financial advisor and I'm not licensed to give you any financial advice. However, I'm simply sharing my own thoughts when it comes to price delivery.

But when it comes to these technicals right here, look, this is an objective way of looking at the markets. Yes, it's based around time and price. Now what's going to be the differentiating factor in terms of results which people will have if they decide on their own to utilize this information—first on the simulation account and later down the line of course on other accounts—what's going to be the differentiating factor are these two elements right here: risk management and operator management.

Meaning the more aggressive traders who will have higher risk tolerances, they will be able to make more returns than the conservative traders, of course, if they apply operator management correctly. Because that's the next step: learning to manage yourself, getting to know yourself. And this is where journaling plays a crucial role—getting to know basically what makes you tick, what makes you do great things, or what makes you go down the wrong path.

And once you have experienced those different experiences and you're able to come to terms with, "Okay, this is who I am as a trader, this is what makes me tick," that's when you're able to authentically excel.

## Final Thoughts on Protocol Development

So when you go into the charts and you begin thinking about, "Okay, I'm going to try and pursue a career of trading," for maybe full-time or maybe you're going to do it part-time besides your regular business or job, but if you decide on your own to make the decision, submit to time, because you need to learn operator management. And the only way to learn that is by paying attention to the lessons which I've already provided to you and by journaling, by submitting to time and going through the experiences. And that is crucial.

But I hope that this video and this lecture has given you a good insight on how you can define your own protocol. Again, I highly suggest you to check out Miro. Again, I'm not affiliated with them. I don't have a code or anything like that. I don't get anything for mentioning them during this lecture, but I've been using them for years and I absolutely love the platform. It's super clean and it's a super easy way of defining flowcharts, and therefore I really suggest you to check it out.

Because look, I know some of you are probably going to take screenshots from everything which I've shown during this lecture and you're going to just copy paste it and you're going to think, "Okay, this is all that there is to it." You can do that, yes. But use this as a foundation, meaning use this as a foundation which you can build upon for yourself. This is your personal model, your personal protocol which we're developing. It's not simply "oh, copy paste Zeussy's foundational protocol and that's it." No. Remove things that you don't like, add things that you want to add, and move based upon that.

And that is why I found it so important to create this lecture for you. I hope that you found this insightful. I hope that you have gotten a great insight on how to eventually begin with developing your own protocols.

And during the next episodes, what I will be sharing with you—I'll be sharing with you application. And that means that in an uncensored style, I'm going to be discussing examples of the protocol being in play, etc.

Good luck with your studies and I look forward to speaking to you in the next one. Be safe!
