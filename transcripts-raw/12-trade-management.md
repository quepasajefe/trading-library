# Trade Management - 2025 Model Series Lecture 12

Hello there, I hope you're doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. During this lecture I will be discussing trade management. So far throughout this series I've outlined to you how to anticipate when and where a trade setup is going to present itself, how to frame the trade idea and how to actually enter into the position. However, during this lecture what I will be discussing is how you can manage your position as it is ongoing.

## The Foundation: Aligning with IPDA

Now when it comes to trade management, one of the most important things to understand is that you must align yourself with IPDA. This however takes place before you even enter the position, meaning in advance of you pressing the buy or sell button, you must have already determined how you anticipate that the market is going to deliver. To not make that anticipation and to not make that analysis would be foolishness, right? Only put on a position where you know exactly what should happen next. If there's any doubt about what's going to happen next, you shouldn't even be in a trade.

If you do find yourself in a trade that you know you shouldn't be in and your subconscious is signaling to you to get out—so you could notice this by for example that your heartbeat begins to rise or that your palms begin to get sweaty or that you begin to get a headache or you begin to just notice that you're overthinking etc.—all those signs that are present then are signaling to you: get out. Meaning get out of the position and log the outcome, journal it.

And the reason why this is very important and why I'm bringing this up at the beginning of trade management is due to the fact that you do not want to fall into the trap of creating a toxic cycle for yourself where you're justifying getting into poor trades, and that once you're in that trade you're just managing it, so to say, simply because you put on the position. No, whenever you put on a trade and you realize that you shouldn't be in that position, you immediately get out of the position. That right there has to be the standard operating procedure.

Because that is something which I'm teaching to you within this Models series: I'm basically teaching to you how to make your whole process and your whole approach to the markets way more objective and way more mechanical in the sense of these are the standard operating procedures. This is the SOP. This is what I'm supposed to do at this moment in time, and that sometimes means that you need to simply say, "Okay, you know what, I'm not going to go out in the markets and risk equity right now." Simply close the position and log the outcome.

## Technical Trade Management Components

Now when it comes to trade management from a technical perspective however, there are a variety of things which we can look at, and those are the things which I want to put emphasis on during this lecture.

In front of you, you can see the Nasdaq one-minute timeframe, and we're going to be discussing how we frame this market maker buy model and how we were able to ride the market up higher. It wasn't just me who took this trade. Many other students took this same trade on the 6th of May 2025, and the reason why I mention this is because that should be a source of inspiration that the information which I'm outlining to you is transferable. Meaning other people are able to do the same things as I'm doing them, and that shows that the theory which I'm teaching with regards to time and price, it's transferable, and therefore that should be a huge source of inspiration.

That is not me guaranteeing to you that one day you'll be able to trade like me. I'm not saying that. However, I am saying that if you put in the required time and effort, you are going to look at these markets from a completely different perspective and you decide on your own to one day maybe put on risk or not if it isn't for you.

But with that being said, what I would like you to do is I would like you to pause this lecture for a moment and I would like you to look at this delivery which occurred and I would like you to try and basically visualize for yourself where you would feel comfortable entering the position and how you would manage the position as it's continuing to move higher.

## The Three Pillars: Entries, Invalidations, and Targets

Now when it comes to trade management, it's important that we begin looking at trade management through the lens of the following perspective. First of all, we have defined the whole idea already. We have defined that this is going to be the smart money reversal, so we saw the sell side of the curve, now we anticipate the buy side of the curve—that's the given, that's a must. However, when we look at trade management in particular, we must pay attention to entries, invalidations, and targets.

- **Entries** are the price at which you look to enter the position, at which you want to, in this case, buy the market.
- **Invalidations** are your stop loss—this is where your idea of higher prices gets invalidated if that level gets crossed, and that is basically where you put your stop loss. That is how you protect your capital, your equity.
- **Your target** is the level that you're aiming for, and usually it's not just one target—you have multiple targets.

Invalidations, you only have one of, but this invalidation level moves as price continues to expand in your favor. That's something which you will see.

## Bullish Example Analysis

So I hope that you paused the lecture and I hope that you paid attention to this delivery, that you investigated how you would have managed it, because what I'm going to do is I'm going to zoom in with you. I'm going to make my lipstick appear on the chart.

What I would like to show is that I've just put my lipstick on the chart, and what you can see is that first of all I've outlined an original consolidation. This original consolidation is up here, and what I would like to show is that when you pay attention to this original consolidation, you very clearly see that the market consolidated here, expanded to the lower, and we saw the market eventually turn around and begin drawing higher.

Now what we are discussing during this lecture has to do with how we manage our position as the market is expanding in our favor. Now as price is turning around right here—exactly at the opening of the third 90 minutes cycle of the morning session at 10 a.m.—what you can see is that the market has this imbalance which gets created right here. This imbalance gets created inside of this bullish breaker. This up close candle—why is this a breaker? Well, you see an expansion lower, we form a low, market retraces higher and it forms a high inside of the FVG right here below the FVG which I've annotated (but we'll get to the importance of this higher FVG in a bit). And we then see the market have one more push lower, forming SMT, and we reach a point of interest.

Point of interest is 19,750 as you can see, and do you see how the bodies are respecting that level right there? This is one of those algorithmic signatures which I like to see. When I see that the market is respecting specific levels which I'm monitoring to the tick, because when I see that, that is signaling to me IPDA and the algorithms which are delivering price.

You must look at IPDA, by the way—and this is just a side note—IPDA by itself is just a term which we utilize for all these algorithms which are responsible for the repricing of markets. Something to think about.

But when it comes to the market respecting a specific price level which we already know in advance, and we see the bodies respecting that level to the tick, that right there's an algorithmic signature which shows to you that these high frequency trading algorithms are firing in long orders at this stage. They're beginning to change from sell program to buy program. This large up close candle right here which forms this FVG shows that to you, because you see market structure shift pattern: FVG, high, FVG. The retracement into this FVG right here can be your entry.

### Initial Stop Loss Placement

Where is your stop loss going to be? Now this presents a variety of reasons. And as a newer student, you should consider placing it below the SMR, placing it below the smart money reversal. That is the safest possible option. And the reason why I mention that is because when you're completely new, your job is to basically make sure that you're in a position and that you're able to manage it as best as possible, right?

When it comes to experienced students that have seen what I'm outlining right here in front of you over and over again, you know that the stop loss can actually be placed higher. Why can it be placed higher? Well, the reason why it can be placed higher is due to the following. When we pay attention—I'm just going to zoom in for you right here—when we pay attention to this low right here, do you see how this sell side liquidity pool was taken out by this long wick? And do you see how the bodies kept on closing above it right there? That sell side liquidity pool was engineered at a specific level. There's no need for the market to ever return back towards that level unless your idea is wrong.

So what that means is that your stop loss can be moved towards this low right here. Now you see that the difference in this example is only minor—there aren't a lot of differences in terms of points. However, you must understand that as the volatility increases and you begin looking at for example bigger price swings, you must understand that that minor difference can really be the difference when it comes to your position sizing. And therefore this is where the invalidation is for me.

Notice that this lines up with that key level right here. I would never want to see the market trade below that key level again after we already saw the reversal sequence in play right here. Meaning this is my initial entry, invalidation, target is that buy side liquidity pool.

### Pyramiding and Moving Stop Losses

Now what I would like to show is that as the market continues to find support inside of this FVG and I'm not saying by the way that this is the final objective because the final objective was way higher, right? However, when it comes to trade management, I'm simply showing to you this is how you can objectively define entry, invalidation, target. And this is simply an example of a market maker buy model which we're discussing.

Now to understand that you should frame these setups from the sequences I've been teaching to you within this Models series—so always from a higher timeframe down into a lower timeframe. What I would like to show is that when the market forms this low inside of this FVG and we see this expansion higher taking place, do you see how the market then reprices above this FVG to the left right here?

This FVG is important because when you pay attention to a FVG, you can see that this was the highest FVG which formed throughout the left side of the curve. Meaning you have a sequence of imbalances right here which displaces through this low—9:30 low. My eye is drawn towards the highest FVG of the sequence of imbalances. I can already frame a long setup from that FVG once we displace through that. But when we displace through the higher FVG, that's when I know, "Okay, price is now actually in a buy program and it's absolutely 100% confirmed."

So what I can do then is say, "Okay, well when the market closes outside of that FVG, I want to see that FVG function as an inversion fair value gap. I want to see it function as support in price." Therefore, when the market eventually retraces right here, that's again a potential buying opportunity. That's again an opportunity to get long if you weren't long yet.

Here comes the thing: what I'm doing is I'm pyramiding into my existing position. So that means I'm adding more to a position which is running in my favor. And by adding more contracts to the position which is running in my favor, I'm able to increase the potential profit on that position whilst keeping the risk relatively equal or whilst having way less risk.

But here comes the thing: when I see the market reprice higher like this and I see it reprice above the high which set this retracement lower, there's absolutely no way that I would want to see the market displace below this low. The reason why is because of the following: this low already showed a willingness to reprice higher. Why? Because do you see how the bodies kept on closing outside of that FVG? The only scenario in which this low could be taken out is if there would be SMT present quickly, meaning where one market would take out this low whilst the other market doesn't, and then a quick rejection to go higher. However, that is not a preferred scenario in this case. And the reason why is because we already displaced above this FVG.

So what I want to see is I want to see the market retrace. I'm buying more in this area right here, understanding that the market is going to expand likely soon. And therefore when the market has this push higher where you see this large up close candle and you see this run right here, from that moment in time my invalidation moves. Meaning initial invalidation was down here as we said, new invalidation becomes here. I would not place my stop loss right here. I would instead manually close it if I see displacement below that low taking place.

### Active Position Monitoring

So what I'm doing is actually basically monitoring my positions actively. The reason why I'm doing so is because I want to be in sync with IPDA. This is not to promote the idea of basically being fearful or being like over-worried about the position whatsoever. That's not what I'm doing. I'm making sure that I'm aligned with IPDA because I know when I'm aligned with IPDA, it should expand when I anticipate it to expand. It should form a low where I anticipate it to form a low. And that is what a low was just created on the low strike.

And whenever the market is not delivering as I'm outlining it to you here and it instead trades beyond my invalidation level, that right there's a huge warning sign for the delivery which is about to come.

When we see the market then displace higher away from this FVG and we see this large FVG get established, what my eye is drawn to is the reaction to that FVG. Do you see how we again tap into the FVG and then expand higher? This is again IOF which is taking place—institutional order flow in action. Therefore, we should never see the market displace below this FVG area again, and particularly this low because this was a protected low. But that's something which we're going to look at in a bit.

So when the market expands higher like this, what we're doing is our invalidation moves towards this low. Why this low? Because this low set up the creation of this imbalance. So every single time that the market is displacing higher, our invalidation level is moving and moving and moving, and what we're doing is we're minimizing the risk on a position which is running in our favor.

### Risk Management Philosophy

Here comes the thing: as the newer student, your goal is to remove risk. You're fearful. You're not able to have risk on the table. Why? Because your mind isn't in the right state of mind yet. And that is something which we're going to discuss later during this Models series and throughout future sit-downs where I'm going to be teaching to you how to actually think like a trader.

But what I want you to understand is that as a newer student, you're fearful of risk. However, if you have more experience, you know that there should be risk on the table always. And therefore what we can do is we can basically say, "Okay, instead of removing risk completely, the market is showing exactly what we need to see. Why not pyramid? Why not add to a position which is winning?" And by adding to a position that is winning, we're able to maximize our profits whilst keeping the risk relatively equal.

### SMT and Breakaway Gaps

So when the market displaces higher like this, what I'm looking for is I'm looking for these new discount arrays to function as support in price. So what I would like to show is that when we pay attention to the market relationship then—on the left you can see Nasdaq, on the right you can see ES—what you can see is that when we pay attention to the low which formed inside of this FVG right here, this low got taken out on Nasdaq. Look closely. Do you see that? Let me zoom in. Do you see how they took out that low?

Whilst on ES, when you pay attention to that low of 10:09, you see that ES did not take out the 10:09 low. So that right there is a very small SMT where you can see that ES created a breakaway gap right here whilst Nasdaq traded into the imbalance. That's important because that shows to you that there's an urgency for the market to begin running higher. There's no need for the market to retrace deeper into that imbalance. If there would be a deeper retracement, then you would already anticipate, "Okay, we're likely going to chop around for now."

Moving forward, when the market eventually has this sequence of down close candles and we see this low form at 10:14, what I'm thinking to myself is, "Okay, the moment that we expand above the high of this retracement, there's absolutely no scenario in which price should ever be priced below this low again." Why not? Because what's actually happening—and this is probably going to be too advanced for the majority, but I'll mention this—what's happening in the buy program is that every single key level is being displaced through and it's going to function as support. It might function as resistance at first—that's going to set up a retracement—but when that retracement is completed and the market expands above the retracement high, that should now function as support in price. Why? Because orders are constantly being filled, filled, filled, filled. Retracements are used to engineer new liquidity. This is our fractal: market maker buy model—sell side of the curve, buy side of the curve.

So the moment that the market continues repricing higher, we anticipate a quick repricing to occur. Why? Because the buy side liquidity pool which we're targeting as our objective is so close, and therefore this is going to be a very quick expansion higher. So you see that the market keeps on running, and as it completes this market maker buy model, from that moment in time what you can do is you can extend the original consolidation to the right and you can say this must function as support in price in order for continuation higher to occur.

And this is an important insight to share with you because when an original consolidation gets taken out, it must function as support in price within a market maker buy model for continuation of order flow to occur. And do you see how all these concepts come back to time cycles? How it all has to do with PDH, PDL? On the bottom right here you saw a purge of the previous 30 min cycle and then a reversal taking place towards previous 30 min cycle high. When this previous 30 min cycle high was taken out, we had to see it function as support in price for the market to continue expanding towards the upside.

And please note that previous 30 min cycle high is this down close candle right here, but I'm outlining this up close candle because of the following: when you pay attention to this up close candle, what you can see is that it formed as a bullish breaker where you see low to the left and you see a high form, lower low, high, high. So this up close candle should function as support in price. It's a very important level. Therefore...

Now what I would like you to see is that the market eventually just chops around, but this is where we are able to say this is a low resistance liquidity run market maker buy model. And when it comes to defining low resistance liquidity runs, you must be able to anticipate them coming from the higher timeframes. So if you follow all the steps of this protocol, you will see where low resistance liquidity runs will take place and where not. Later throughout this Models series I will touch on the full protocol and we're going to be looking at flow charts which you can use to investigate the delivery.

## Bearish Example Analysis

When we pay attention to a bearish example then, what I would like you to do is I would like you to pause this lecture for a moment and I would like you to try and see where you would enter in this sell program, where you would place your invalidation and how you would manage this position.

I hope that you paused the lecture because I'm now going to add my lipstick to the chart. What you can see right here is that I've outlined multiple imbalances on the chart and on Nasdaq I've annotated some levels. What I would like to show is that the market repriced above the 18,250 level right here and we saw the market distort time up here. Do you see how it was just consolidating? Eventually the market reprices higher at 10:28 right here, takes out buy side liquidity resting above this high, and we then see this large displacement leg lower take place. Do you see how large these down close candles are and how quick they are?

We see the market retrace and the market just consolidates. It's going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Do you see however that there's a certain pattern which is being set up? And that's the following. What I would like to show is that we form this high, form a low, high, high, low, low. So what I would like to show is that within this bigger reversal which has taken place, you're seeing a smaller reversal occur where you see that the market actually showed a willingness to displace below this low which set up the final run higher. And therefore you know that between the time cycle of 10:30 to 11 o'clock, this low should function as resistance in price.

Here comes the thing: when you pay attention to a low to the left as well—this low—you can see that this low is also important because it's the low that formed exactly at 18,250 and it's the low that formed at 10:31. Now what I'm outlining to you is that I'm paying attention to at what time important lows and highs are forming, and by paying attention to time—and in this case through the lens of 10 minute cycles—what I'm about to share with you is the following.

### Time Cycles and Macro Periods

What I'm about to share with you is that when we pay attention to 10 minute cycles, what you can see is that between 10:30 to 10:40 we have a 10 minute cycle. The low of the 10 minute cycle is right here. And do you see that between 10:50 to 11:00 we also have a 10 minute cycle? So what we're doing is we're dividing the 30 minute cycles into threes, and what you can see is that the market reprices between 10:40 to 10:50 through these lows that are crucial on the left. So first of all this low right here, and through the previous 10 min cycle low—this low. Do you see how this FVG forms right here?

Now this FVG by itself is a short, and the reason why is because at what time is this short being presented? At exactly 10:45, which is the beginning of our second macro for the New York morning session that we're interested in. Meaning from 10:45 to 11:15. There are macros in advance of this, so 9:45 to 10:15 is also one which I like. And on Nasdaq we also have them prior to the regular trading hours. However, the main focus should be on 9:45 to 10:15 and 10:45 to 11:15.

So exactly at 10:45 the market retraces into the FVG and we see the market form a high there. Now when it comes to managing this position, what I would like you to understand is that when we refer back to the trade management of the entry patterns as I've told you throughout the previous lecture of this series, what I would like to share is that whenever you have a FVG, the stop can be placed above the first candle's high which sets up the creation of the FVG. So this candle's high right here.

There's absolutely no way that price should get towards that level if we are expecting the sell program. Why? Because look to the left—you have the previous 10 min cycle low which should function as resistance in price, and there's no way that price would displace above this FVG if we are bearish. Therefore, you must look at this as, "Okay, this is indeed a crucial FVG."

Now if you believe that this stop loss placement is too tight for you and you would like—and I'm referring to a market structure perspective here in terms of too tight or too wide—and the reason why is due to the following. When you look at the points, you can see that this is already a 40 point stop loss. And when you place it above this high right here, you have a 76 point stop loss. That's a result of the increased levels of volatility at the time of this recording. However, understand that it's all around basically position sizing, and therefore don't look at a maximum amount of points to be a stop loss. Surely if your stop loss on an index is going to be hundreds of points, that's not worth it. However, when we are looking at for example a 76 point stop loss and we're aiming for a run of let's say 200-300 points, that's still worth taking. Why? Because what you can see is that our objective at first is the sell side liquidity pool which formed throughout the first 10 minutes of trading.

Think back to the market maker buy model which I showed to you. I know the majority of people, they skip through these lectures saying, you know, they take the parts which they find interesting and then they move on to the next one. However, if you listen closely, you will hear that throughout the lectures that are completely on a specific topic, I actually hint at other things. That's just how I hide certain gems in plain sight because I'm not teaching for the lazy. I'm not teaching the person that is like, "Oh, show me how to do it and I'll do it next day," right? That's not how it works. You need to investigate the fine details because by investigating the fine details, you're able to see what is hidden in plain sight.

### Managing the Bearish Position

But what I would like you to understand is that the stop loss placement which I showed here is the safest possible option. So for newer students, this is the stop loss placement which is likely going to be the most comfortable at first. And the reason why is due to the fact that there's a lot of room for the market to retrace deeper than that initial entry pattern. However, if you're already more experienced and you have already gotten more chart time, you know how IPDA delivers price and when it should deliver price—so when these volatility injections are going to take place—then you can of course manage it tighter. But for the sake of easiness, let's just say that this is going to be the invalidation at first.

Now when it comes to the next invalidation which then gets established, you should see the following. What I would like to show is that when the market reprices lower and it takes out the low which set up the retracement into the imbalance, we want to see this high remain intact—the high which formed inside of the FVG. And the reason why is because of the fact that if we would see FVG high and then displacement above that high, that would actually be a bullish market structure shift, especially when a FVG gets created. And therefore the moment the price displaces lower here—and this comes back to what I was saying with regards to what happens in a low resistance liquidity run towards the upside, but now in reverse since we're looking at the sell program—it's a matter of basically aligning yourself with IPDA.

During a low resistance liquidity run, every single expansion is going to get followed by a retracement, is going to get followed by an expansion. Whenever that second expansion occurs, you want to see the retracement leg which occurred function as resistance in price. Therefore your stop loss can be placed above this high next. And if you are not short yet, you short the retracement into that low. Why? Because that low right here—that high—should function as resistance in price.

So when the market then reprices lower, advances again, we see it reprice below this sequence of imbalances. We want to see this sequence of imbalances function as resistance in price. This does not mean that you're going to place a stop loss right above the box. Why not? Because price distortion should or could take place. It's not should, it's could. And price distortion—what's price distortion? Price distortion is when IPDA colors outside of the lines. Yep, did he really just say that? Yep. Man oh man, I have so many tools in my arsenal and I'm slowly introducing some of them to you.

But what I would like to show is that when IPDA trades below this sequence of imbalances, reaches 50 percent of the range between 18,250 to 18,000 right here, we want to see the market retrace into that sequence of imbalances, but we need to see the market close inside of this sequence of imbalances. Do you see how at 11:02 right here we wick above the imbalance right here, but do you see how the bodies keep on closing inside of it? That right there shows to us that the underlying order flow is still bearish.

### Manual vs Fixed Invalidations

But since this lecture is on trade management, you're probably asking yourself, "How would I manage this position when the market displaces below the sequence of imbalances?" Well, what you could be looking for is you could manually be looking for the following. What you can say is, "Okay, if price closes aggressively above this blue box"—so you would see a big up close candle above it—then you could say, "Okay, I'm going to cut the position." Why? Because you didn't see that sequence of imbalances function as resistance in price.

When it comes to placing a hard stop, so a fixed invalidation, I would say that when price expands lower like this, go to the basically the latest up close candle which formed before it expanded lower, or the latest high which formed, I should say, and then simply put your invalidation there. So my eye is drawn immediately towards this level right here. And the reason why is because I see this high right here at 10:53 and market then expands towards the downside.

So what you can see is that that invalidation is simply due to the fact that, you know, manual intervention could take place and an announcement could be made that they want to make sure that you're out of the short. However, if price would close above this sequence of imbalances and you would see a big green candle, then it's already a sign of, "Okay, well, I should probably manually close the position."

And this is how you see that you must allow for basically a—I don't want to call it a room of less objectivity, that's not what I'm saying because it is very objective. It's a very straightforward rule: when price is not utilizing that sequence of imbalances as resistance in price, you get out. That's the rule. However, you must monitor the position. It's not like you can just set the trade and walk away.

Because think about it right—and this is one of the things which really pisses me off about the whole trading industry—you have people that say, "Okay, you put on the trade and you just let it run. You don't manage it, you don't look at it, and you just log the outcome in a few hours," right? But when you think about it, right, your perspective on the markets is becoming so objective where you're beginning to understand time and price. Once you get to that level of understanding, you can anticipate every single price swing. You can anticipate reverses before they form. And therefore to not then protect yourself and actually take some profit when you see that the underlying sequence has changed from sell to buy program is foolishness, right?

So do you see what I'm getting at right there? Very important insight which I'm sharing with you here. So that's not to say, "Oh, you should not use fixed invalidations." Absolutely you should use fixed invalidations. But in an example like this, you cannot say, "Oh, I'm going to place my stop loss above the blue box," because you would get taken out here and you would be frustrated when the market runs in your favor eventually.

The sell side liquidity pool as the draw on liquidity gets reached, and from that moment in time what we're monitoring is whether or not that low is going to function as resistance in price. So what we can do is we can say, "Okay, this down close candle, this low can be extended to the right and should function as resistance in price in order for the underlying order flow to remain bearish."

What you see is that the market retraces into that down close candle, into the low of 9:30-10:00, and eventually continues expanding lower. Now as price continues to trade lower like this, what you can do is say, "Okay, once this swing high forms, stop loss can be trailed to this high." However, when the 18,000 price level gets met, that's usually already a good level to get out.

However, when we pay attention to the delivery which occurred, you can see that the market eventually just chops around for a bit before it continues to expand lower. You cannot look at this and think to yourself, "Oh, I should have been a part of that." No. Why not? Because you already participated in the low resistance liquidity run which provided you with a range of opportunity from here to the 18,000 price level of about 275 points.

So when you think about that—I don't know where you're from—but if you're able to make 275 points on just one mini or a few minis or even micros to be fair, that's already a good amount of returns which you're able to make right there. So don't think that you should be trading thousand point moves or whatever. No. Learn to be content with enough.

## Conclusion

I hope that this raw style lecture has basically given you some good insights when it comes to trade management. When preparing this lecture, I thought to myself, "Do I want to make a presentation, or do I want to make more of a raw lecture style?" And I believe that trade management is something which you learn through experience. So I hope that by me explaining these things and going over the charts with you, you have gotten a good insight from my own experience and that you have gotten a good idea of what the rules are when it comes to managing positions and whatnot.

I want to wish you good luck with your studies. Trade management is again something which you learn through chart time. So paying attention to what happens the moment that your entry presents itself—don't think, "Oh, it's just entry, stop, target." No. Look at what happens between the movement from your entry to the target because you will see that there are usually more opportunities to pyramid into a position.

We'll dive into all of this with risk management and such. However, look at where the opportunities are being presented and look at how your invalidation level can be moved as the trade progresses in your favor so you can decrease risk and such.

Good luck with your studies and I look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture of the 2025 Models Series. Be safe!
