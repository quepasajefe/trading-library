# Questions Answered - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. During this lecture I'm going to be discussing the most frequently asked questions which came as a result of students having gone through the Models series up until this point. These questions were asked either through a support page or they were asked in my DMs.

Now before we dive into this lecture, I would like to share with you that the majority of questions which were asked were either based around order flow or transitioning from higher timeframe into lower timeframe analysis and what to look for. So I'm going to be providing to you the answers to these questions.

Now what I've done is I've defined these questions as best as possible to make them as general as possible as well. The first question which we're going to be discussing is: How do we determine the order flow when we open our charts, meaning how do we determine whether or not we're currently in bullish or bearish order flow?

Secondly, we're going to be discussing how we can blend narrative with technicals, meaning how we can blend the overall understanding behind why something should happen with what the chart is telling to us—whether price is bullish or bearish.

The third question which we're going to be discussing is: How can we utilize lower timeframes if we have established higher timeframe IOF?

## Question 1: How Do We Determine Order Flow When We Open Our Charts?

We're going to begin with the first question at first, and that is: How do we determine the order flow when we open our charts?

When it comes to this question, it's important to note that the order flow gets established by first paying attention to, "Okay, what is the market structure signaling to you from the highest possible timeframes?" Meaning what are the highest possible timeframes—think daily, weekly, monthly charts—telling to you? Is price right now in a buy program or is price right now in a sell program?

Once you have defined what the highest possible timeframes are signaling to you in terms of direction, you look into the lower timeframes to see whether or not price is confirming that same direction.

Meaning if we are looking at the Nasdaq hourly chart right now—and at the time of this recording it's the beginning of June and we have been very bullish on the indices, on the American indices futures—if we have established that right there, we're going to be looking for the signs every single week that signal to us, "Okay, price is likely going to expand towards a specific level, a specific range." This is our draw on liquidity.

Once we have established this range, what we can be looking for is we can be looking for buying opportunities heading into that level. Once this draw on liquidity gets met however, that is when you need to be cautious.

### NFP Week Example

So when it comes to the week which you have in front of you right now, this was NFP week, and in this NFP week what we saw taking place was the following. What we saw taking place was first of all that when we open up right here, we saw the market drop lower for the beginning of the week. This took place throughout the Sunday open and throughout Monday.

Notice that we eventually form a low right here and we see the market expand towards the upside. Notice that this low formed at 3am, meaning throughout the London session on Monday. We saw the market expand towards the upside and we saw it reach this hourly FVG right here on the left side of the curve. I'm going to be extending the FVG to the right.

Notice that the market rejected this FVG at first and we saw the market retrace. Notice that the market repriced lower and notice that it repriced into what? It repriced into the yearly open right here.

A new day opens up—the day of Tuesday—and what happens? Open, low. Do you see what I'm paying attention to? I'm paying attention to how we're opening up for the week and for the days. And the reason being is because by paying attention to that open low right there, you're able to establish, "Hey, we're manipulating lower now for the beginning of the day whilst we already know that on the higher timeframes we're bullish."

So what that means is that we're looking for the fact that the lower timeframes are confirming to us intraday. Yes, we are in fact forming lows of day during London, and because that occurs, you can anticipate that the New York morning session should expand towards the upside. Why? Because you have a draw on liquidity of the previous week's high right here.

The moment that the new week opens up, your eye is immediately drawn to, "Okay, where's previous week's high? Where's previous week's low?" Once you have established that the higher timeframe order flow is bullish and price shows you that it is in a rush to get somewhere, that is when you can confidently say previous week's high is going to be the level which price is going to be drawn towards.

However, what's important to note is that in advance of the previous week's high, what you can see is that we have this hourly FVG right here. This hourly FVG could function as a big hinder on price. And when I say hinder on price, what I mean is that price could reach this range and reject it multiple times. Why? Because if we zoom into this range right here, what I would like to show is that we formed a low right here. We repriced higher and then we displaced through this low with this FVG.

Therefore, what we can anticipate is that when price reprices into this range, it is being repriced into an imbalanced price range. And the moment that price leaves this imbalanced price range, this price range becomes balanced. And therefore price is going to try and fight against a balanced price range. And whenever price is trying to fight against a balanced price range, what that looks like is the following: A lot of back and forth going around that range right there.

And when you pair this with the week, you can notice that we have NFP week. So throughout NFP week, this is the type of delivery which you anticipate.

### Framework for Establishing Order Flow

And when it comes to how we establish our higher timeframe order flow the moment that we open our charts, it's important to note is that there's a framework to this, and that's the following.

First of all, what you do is you define what is occurring on the highest possible timeframes. And when I say highest possible timeframes, I'm speaking in terms of, "Okay, what are the bigger time cycles suggesting? What's the quarterly cycle suggesting? What's the monthly cycle suggesting? What's the weekly cycle suggesting?"

Once these all tell you a specific story, the next step is then to look at the weekly cycle and begin paying attention to how each individual day is delivering. Because based upon how each individual day is delivering, you can anticipate what the next day is likely going to do.

When you pay attention to Monday and Tuesday, what you can see is that Monday expands towards the upside right here, and when you pay attention to Tuesday, you can see that Tuesday also expands towards the upside right here. Notice that I'm anchoring the full day range from low to high. Notice that these ranges are rather large.

So what should happen? Well, on Wednesday we see price reach our point of interest or our draw on liquidity. It's the same—every single A to B turns into a new A to B as I've been teaching you throughout this Models series. So what you can anticipate for Wednesday is a small range day.

So when you pay attention to the range which got established on Wednesday, what you can see is that price kept on coming back towards the range of that same FVG. So do you see how we're blending when we come to the charts? Time cycles from the bigger time cycles to the smaller time cycles. And when we navigate each new week, we pay attention to, "Okay, what did the previous day do?" Because based upon what the previous day did, we can logically anticipate what the current day is likely going to do.

So what I would like you to start paying attention to is what's happening on any given day, and then see whether or not your weekly objective gets met. When your weekly objective gets met, that is when you should be cautious with holding on to that same idea which you had at the beginning of the week.

### Key Points for Determining Order Flow

So if we pay attention to the first question—how do we determine the order flow when we open our charts—what you pay attention to is a variety of things.

First of all, you pay attention to whether or not discount arrays or premium arrays are functioning as either support or resistance in price. That's the given.

Next step, you pay attention to the openings of each new day. If you pay attention to what happens from the midnight open (12 a.m. New York time), you pay attention to what the London session does. You can anticipate what the New York morning session is likely going to do. Based upon how the New York morning session delivers, you can anticipate what the afternoon session is likely going to do.

So what you're doing is you're taking it one session at a time. And that is a major tip which I want to give to you, where I want you to become more fluid when it comes to finding opportunities. And the reason being is because the model as I've taught to you throughout this series provides a lot of opportunities, and the way that you find your opportunity is by sticking on the hourly chart as long as possible.

## Question 2: How Can We Blend Narrative with Technicals?

Now when it comes to the following question then: How can we blend narrative with technicals?

Well, in order to blend narrative with technicals, we must first be able to establish narrative. This is something which I discussed in great detail within the swing trading series which I released at the beginning of 2025. I really suggest you to go over that even if you're not a swing trader. But in that series I teach how the masses are getting tricked into false beliefs, and if they are getting tricked into a false belief whilst the chart is telling you a completely different story, then you know that a high probability trade setup is being set up.

And the way that you can internalize this is by looking at the following: What's the reason why everyone would be bearish now? And if you recognize the reason why everyone would be bearish now but the chart is telling you higher, then you have a very good setup. If you recognize that the masses are bullish but the chart is bearish to you, then you again have a very good setup.

So what you can see is that we're basically going against the masses when the chart tells us to do so. This also however means if the chart does not tell us to go against the masses, we simply just keep on looking for longs. Let's say that the market is just skyrocketing, it's just running up higher vertically, and the masses are of course turning bullish—as long as price has yet to reach its draw on liquidity, has yet to reach this point B, we keep on looking for one thing and that is longs. So longs, longs, longs, longs, longs, longs.

If price is showing nothing but weakness and just dumping and has yet to reach point B or draw on liquidity on the downside, we keep on looking for shorts. Why? Because the technicals are suggesting to us that we should do so.

So what you can see is that narrative is this concept which is important when blended with the technicals. The majority of people, they simply look at what the newspapers are saying, they look at what goes around on social media, they think to themselves that that's the reason why price goes up and down. That's nothing to do with what gets shared on the news. However, the news gets utilized to reprice in a specific way. So our job is anticipating whether or not that news is being utilized for manipulation purposes so that distribution can take place afterwards.

### A Beautiful Example

A beautiful example of this is right in front of you. And at the time of this recording, there is a lot of chaos in the world. There's a lot of news which is being thrown around. There's a lot of manual intervention taking place. But what happened on Thursday right here was that President Trump and Elon Musk went head to head with each other. They used to be friends, so to say, to the public, but they now came out as enemies. They were going against each other and it happened right here on Thursday.

Do you see what happens? Price reprices lower towards the yearly open, towards an old area of inefficiency which price was yet to trade into right here, which got established on Tuesday. Forms a low there and boom—reprices higher right away. Why? Why does that occur? Because technically speaking, IPDA had to reprice into this old inefficiency at one moment in time. You should pay attention to this—you will see that it formed inside of a FVG as well. Note that this is a very important high to monitor.

But do you see how the news gets utilized to make sure that that repricing order takes place? Look, whenever you recognize that news is being thrown around on social media or you see it within the news headlines etc., the moment that you recognize that and the news is telling you something which goes completely against what the chart is telling to you, then you know, "Man oh man, this is sweet." Why? Because they're setting up a beautiful setup.

## Question 3: How Can We Utilize Lower Timeframes If We Have Established Higher Timeframe IOF?

Now the third question is: How can we utilize the lower timeframes if we have established higher timeframe IOF?

When it comes to utilizing lower timeframes once we have established higher timeframe IOF, the main takeaway which I want you to have is the following: When we have established that the higher timeframe direction is for example bullish, we will continuously look for longs until our draw on liquidity on the higher timeframe analysis has been met. Once this higher timeframe analysis has been met however—this draw on liquidity—that is where we can be looking for opposing scenarios.

Why? Because who is making money on this run higher? Buyers. So who is IPDA likely going to target when we see the signs present of a reversal taking place at point B, at our draw on liquidity? It's going to attack those buyers. Their stops are engineered—sell side liquidity.

So a beautiful way that you can internalize this is that the moment that your higher timeframe DOL gets met, go to neutral. Don't have any expectation. Price could continue, price could reject, price could consolidate. There are a lot of different scenarios which take place. However, you wait for IPDA to show its hand to you. And when it shows its hand to you and it shows to you, "Yes, I'm in fact going to reject that point B which you had as your draw on liquidity," you see all the lower timeframe signatures which are in play.

So think of time cycle SMT, think of manipulation ahead of that time cycle SMT, think of CSD following. When you see all these different signatures in play, that is when you can establish, "Okay, the moment that price indeed begins to roll over and it begins to create premium arrays, those premium arrays can get utilized to find a shorting opportunity."

But here comes the thing: your focus has to be on swing formations, recognizing whether or not a swing high or swing low is forming. And in the example which we're discussing now, where I'm discussing a hypothetical example—I hope that you're able to visualize what I'm outlining to you—if price reaches that draw on liquidity which you had on the upside and you see the signs of a swing high formation taking place, the moment that price indeed confirms that swing high formation through SMT and you see CSD taking place, that is when you know price should roll over.
