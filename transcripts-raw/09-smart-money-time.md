# Smart Money Time (SMT) - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on SMT—Smart Money Time.

## SMT as a Confirmation Tool

First of all, before we dive into this lecture, I would like to share with you that SMT is a confirmation tool. Nothing more. Meaning, SMT is not a tool which you utilize to simply determine bias. It's not a tool which you utilize to determine where to buy or sell. SMT is merely a confirmation tool of your existing analysis being at play.

## Defining Smart Money Time

Let us define what SMT actually means. SMT gets looked at after the prior steps of the protocol are present. Meaning, within this Models series, you have been introduced to concepts in a specific order. SMT forms in this order. Meaning, the prior steps first need to be present before we even consider looking at SMT.

If this is not clear to you, don't worry. Down the line within this series, I'm going to show you the full protocol during a separate lecture.

Because SMT only gets looked at when the prior steps of the protocol are present, we must only look at SMT as a confirmation of the prior existing steps of the protocol. Meaning, SMT functions as a confirmation tool of our process indeed being in play. Our focus is on detecting reversals, and SMT confirms to us that the reversal is taking place.

## Forms of SMT

There are multiple forms of SMT, and during this lecture, I will share multiple with you.

### Form 1: Larger Time Cycle SMT

First of all, we're going to be paying attention to the following form of SMT. This SMT forms over a larger time cycle. And what you can see is that on these two markets, you can see that they are highly correlated. However, the market on the left right here creates a high and then saw the market retrace. What happens between this retracement and eventually the lower high which gets established doesn't really matter. Meaning, the market can just consolidate, it can drop even lower—doesn't matter. Therefore, I've labeled this as irrelevant price action.

What you can see on market two, however, is that market two also forms that first high and it then eventually creates a higher high. This means that market two created a higher high whilst market one created a lower high. This is SMT. Therefore, this is a crack in correlation between these highly correlated markets. And when this is present, this tells you, "All right, we're likely going to see the underlying order flow change soon."

Now, it's important to note that whenever we are paying attention to these swing points, we must blend this with the time cycles. Meaning, it's not just a crack in correlation and therefore—whoop—the market is now expected to turn around. Nope, it is all paired with the logic of the time cycles as I've shared them with you prior during this series. Meaning, we focus on the open of a new time cycle, then we pay attention to the previous cycle high. If one market doesn't take out the previous cycle high whilst the other market does, that's a time cycle SMT.

#### Chart Example: Bearish Time Cycle SMT

When we pay attention to a chart example of this, then what you can see is that on the left, you can see the Nasdaq, and on the right, you can see ES. What I would like you to see is that Nasdaq formed this high right here. We then saw the market reprice towards the upside. Notice that the market came very close to taking out this high, but the market just fell short of it.

If we pay attention to ES, however, what you can see is that ES took out that same high right here. And therefore that shows to you, "Hey, this is actually a crack in correlation between the Nasdaq on the left and the ES on the right," where ES created a higher high, Nasdaq created a lower high, and that SMT set up the reversal which followed afterwards.

#### Bullish Time Cycle SMT

When we pay attention to a bullish example, then the bullish example looks like the following where I can see that market one creates a low right here. Then we see irrelevant price action. Again, it doesn't matter what happens between here. All that matters is that we form this low, then a new time cycle opens up, and we see the market eventually create a higher low relative to this previous cycle low.

If we however pay attention to the market on the right, you can see that the market on the right also forms this low and eventually creates a lower low. Therefore, that's a crack in correlation relative to this low. But in particular, it's a crack in correlation relative to a previous cycle low. That's time cycle SMT.

Now, I understand that for some of you, it might be confusing what I've labeled here as "irrelevant price action." But what I mean by that is that price can literally do whatever it wants to do—meaning it can consolidate, it can expand, whatever, it doesn't matter. What matters is that we see a new time cycle open up and on one market create a lower low relative to the previous cycle low, whilst the other market creates a higher low. That is the importance of this SMT.

### Form 2: Smaller Time Cycle SMT

When we pay attention to another example of SMT, then what we'd like to see is that market one on the left right here creates a higher high, market two on the right right here creates a lower high relative to a swing high. Now, this is your regular form of SMT as the majority of you are probably already familiar with it. But it's important to note that even this SMT is also a time cycle SMT, but it forms on a smaller scale.

Every single market reversal either forms with a breaker formation as you can see on the left right here, or it forms with a mitigation block formation as you can see right here on the right. There's always either a breaker or a mitigation block.

#### Chart Example: Smaller Time Cycle SMT

When we pay attention to a chart example, then what you can see is that on the left, you can see that the Nasdaq expanded towards the upside and formed this high. Eventually we see multiple higher highs formed relative to this high. First higher high formed right here, and eventually the second higher high formed right here.

Notice, however, on the right that we did not see ES take out this high, which is annotated by this red line, meaning ES created lower highs whilst Nasdaq created higher highs. And that is important to note because that shows to you that Nasdaq and ES had SMT present right here.

Now, again, SMT by itself doesn't mean anything. However, because you're anticipating a swing high to form, that is when that SMT begins to hold a lot of significance because that shows to you that the time is right for the underlying order flow to begin changing from buy program to sell program.

### Form 3: Opening Time SMT

Another form of SMT has to do with opening times. This is a more rare variant of SMT, however, I still find it important to share with you. And the reason why is because especially when it comes to anticipating price swings, this is an important concept to understand.

So for example, when it comes to anticipating a low resistance liquidity run, or for example, when anticipating that the underlying order flow might change when you're in a position, it's important to pay attention to key opening times.

When it comes to key opening times, I'm referring, for example, to:
- Weekly open
- Midnight open
- 9:30 open
- Or even every single 90-minute cycle's open

Each one of these opens has to be monitored when it comes to an intermarket relationship perspective. And the reason why is because by looking at intermarket relationships relative to the opening times, you're able to see whether or not cracks in correlation are present. And whenever there's a crack in correlation present, that's usually a sign for either a deep retracement to occur or consolidation.

#### How Opening SMT Works

What I would like you to see is that on the left, you can see that the market expands towards the downside, forms this low, retraces higher, then expands lower once more. Notice, however, that the market did not reach this key open. Instead, we stop right in advance of it.

When we pay attention to the market on the right, then what you can see is that the market expands towards the downside, forms this low, retraces higher, and this market does reach that key open. Where market one did not reach the key open and stopped right in advance of it, you can see that market two actually reached the key open and then began turning around.

So whenever you see SMT relative to a key opening price, pay attention to how the market is likely going to react off that level. And whenever you are in, for example, a short position from up here and you're riding the markets lower, be sure to take partials accordingly when you recognize this form of SMT.

The amount of times that I was in positions and I saw open SMT take place and the market just turned around and immediately began retracing deeply is a lot. And therefore I made the rule for myself: whenever I recognize open SMT, that is a key warning sign. And that's why I'm sharing it with you.

## Important Note: Fractal Nature

Now it's important to note that when it comes to all of these different forms of SMT, they can be blended. Everything which I'm sharing with you during this lecture is fractal, meaning this works across all time cycles. Whether you're looking at monthly cycles, whether you're looking at weekly cycles, whether you're looking at daily cycles, whether you're looking at session cycles, whether you're looking at 90 or 30 or even 10-minute cycles—it's the same logic and it shows to you that time is fractal.

## Double SMT

As a final schematic for this lecture, I would like to share with you the following. What I would like to share with you is that I have put the first two SMT schematics together within this slide.

What you can see is that on the left, you can see that schematic where I outlined to you the bigger time cycle SMT. When it comes to this time cycle SMT, this SMT can be, for example, relative to a daily low or—you know what—let's say a session low. Yes, let's say that this is our London low right here. The market eventually does whatever (this is irrelevant price action), and then throughout the New York morning session, we see the market open low and we see it make a higher low relative to that London low.

Inside of this SMT which is being established right here, followed by this expansion higher, you are going to see on the lower time frames a lower time frame market maker buy model. Now what I prefer to see within that lower time frame market maker buy model is the following: Within the low formation of that lower time frame market maker buy model, I prefer to see a smaller time cycle SMT.

So where we have a session SMT, I absolutely love it when I also see, for example, a 30-minute or 10-minute or even a three-minute cycle SMT present on the lows right here. This is a smaller time cycle SMT. So what you can see is that in this circle, you can see the schematic of that smaller time cycle SMT, but I love to see that inside of a bigger time cycle SMT.

And this is what I refer to as **double SMT**. When I see double SMT, that's my great confirmation of "All right, we've likely formed a low, it's time to buckle up for expansion higher."

## Using the SMT Detector

When you look back at the chart examples which I shared when it comes to these two big time cycle SMTs and small time cycle SMTs, I want you to pay close attention to them because you might notice something.

When it comes to the chart examples which I've outlined when it comes to SMT, it's important that you train your eye for recognizing SMT because you must be able to see these cracks in correlation between these highly correlated markets.

If you however want to automate this approach and you want to save a lot of time and mental hassle, etc., try out the SMT detector, because the SMT detector saves you the effort of having to go out and pay attention closely to what both markets are doing. It simply shows you whenever there's SMT present.

But again, SMT is merely a confirmation tool, meaning without all of the prior steps of this process being in play, the SMT means nothing. Therefore, SMT can only be looked at as a confirmation of your existing idea.

## Summary

With that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that you found it insightful. I want to wish you Happy Easter, because it's Easter at the time of this recording. And I look forward to speaking to you in the next lecture of this Models series. Be safe.
