# CSD: Change in the State of Delivery - 2025 Models Series Lecture

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on CSD—Change in the State of Delivery.

## Important Prerequisites

Now before we dive into this lecture, I find it very important to share with you that I want you to have watched the prior lectures of this 2025 Models series. And the reason why I say that and why I put emphasis on it is due to the fact that a lot of people seem to believe that CSD (Change in the State of Delivery) is merely a pattern within the delivery of price. However, this is not the case.

CSD only holds any significance when the prior steps of the protocol which I'm teaching to you are in play. Therefore, to simply just look for CSD is not enough. And with that being said, I would like to begin this lecture.

## Understanding CSD

CSD confirms the right side of the curve taking place, meaning everything which I'm sharing with you has to do with market maker models. Meaning, I'm sharing with you how you can anticipate how the right side of the curve is likely going to deliver. When we see that the left side of the curve is done delivering, CSD—a change in the state of delivery—will confirm to us that we're going to see the opposing side of the curve deliver, whether it be the buy side of the curve in a market maker buy model or the sell side of the curve within a market maker sell model. During this lecture, I will share with you how you can anticipate that curve to unfold.

## Two States of Delivery

Change in the State of Delivery—CSD. When it comes to CSD, there are two states of delivery:

1. **Buy-side delivery** - During buy-side delivery, price is drawn towards buy-side liquidity, which is resting above old highs. That's why it's called buy-side delivery.

2. **Sell-side delivery** - During sell-side delivery, price is drawn towards sell-side liquidity. This sell-side liquidity is resting below old lows.

The reason why it's important to understand these two delivery functions is because you must understand that at every single given moment in time, IPDA is either being drawn towards buy-side or it's being drawn towards sell-side.

Change in the State of Delivery means that price changes from sell-side to buy-side delivery or from buy-side to sell-side delivery. So what CSD basically represents is that it represents the change between sell-side to buy-side or buy-side to sell-side. And that's also where you begin to see the importance of it, because by paying attention to CSD, you are in fact able to anticipate when that right side of the curve is likely going to unfold.

## Bearish and Bullish Examples

### Bearish CSD

So when we pay attention to a bearish example of this, what you can see is that we see the buy side of the curve deliver in the form of the green line. Then we see a change in the state of delivery taking place, and then the sell side of the curve delivers where the market is drawn towards sell-side liquidity. This is being represented by the red line.

### Bullish CSD

If we would look at an opposing schematic, we would see that the red line lower represents sell-side delivery. We then see a change in the state of delivery taking place and the market draws towards buy-side next. So this is buy-side delivery.

What's important to notice is that these schematics which I've created are of course simplified. They represent the bigger picture. However, within this overall bearish delivery, you are going to see short-term buy-side deliveries taking place where you're going to see short-term retracements higher taking place. These are lower time frame buy programs which are occurring, and therefore you must understand your fractals—from the bigger fractals all the way down to the smaller fractals. This is something which we're going to touch on later throughout this Models series more, because at the end of the day, you must understand that both time and price are fractal. Your job is to align all the fractals with each other.

## CSD and Price Cycles

When we pay attention to this example schematic which I've shown prior throughout this series as well, I would like you to understand that CSD confirms the bullish price cycle taking place, meaning a bullish change in the state of delivery confirms to us that we're going to see the market expand higher from point A, which is below here, to point B, which is up here. The moment that a change in the state of delivery takes place, that is when we can anticipate the market is going to draw towards point B. This is of course the right side of the curve within a market maker buy model where the sell side of the curve is going to be to the left right here.

When we pay attention to a bearish schematic, then what I would like you to understand is that a CSD confirms the bearish price cycle taking place as well, of course, where I can see that the market is drawn from point A to point B, which is below here. What the bearish change in the state of delivery shows to us is that the market is in fact in a rush to draw towards sell-side liquidity next, and therefore we can anticipate that the right side of the curve, which is in this case the sell side of the curve, is going to pan out where you have seen the left side of the curve being the buy side of the curve.

## Bullish Market Structure

When we pay attention to bullish market structure, what I would like you to understand is that the most simple way of looking at bullish market structure is through the following perspective: You can see that the market expands towards the downside, we see retracement higher taking place, and the market has one more push lower taking out sell-side liquidity resting below this low.

When the sell-side liquidity resting below this low gets taken out, what we'll be monitoring is the reaction to this level. The moment that price displaces above that old low, but more in particular above this old high right here which set up this final position lower, that is telling to us, "Hey, this is a bullish breaker in full effect," where you saw a low, high, lower low, higher high taking place. Therefore, we anticipate that this high is likely going to function as support on price next, because when the market retraces into that high, it has to function as support on price to confirm the next expansion higher occurring.

### The Market Structure Shift Pattern

Now, when it comes to this bullish market structure, you can understand that some of you are probably already like, "Okay, we've seen this before. Where does the change in state of delivery take place? Where does it get confirmed that we're going to change from sell to buy program?"

The change in state of delivery gets confirmed right here. The moment that the market trades above this high, I'm looking for the signs of bullish order flow to step in again. And what you can see within this schematic is that I've outlined a light bulb emoji. And the reason why I've outlined the light bulb emoji has to do with market maker models in general.

The moment that price displaces above this high, I'm anticipating that we're now changing from sell to buy program. But do you understand what I outlined prior when it comes to you must have the proper understanding behind the overall process which we're adhering to? Because simply looking for this fractal of a bullish breaker is not going to serve you any well. There are a lot of bullish breakers which form throughout each day, but it's not about simply recognizing the price pattern that's going to lead to the consistency you're looking for.

The consistency that you look for is going to be a result of you having defined when this price pattern will work. And that is what I'm sharing with you throughout this lecture series. So if you investigate in depth, you are going to see exactly what's leading up to these buy programs and sell programs unfolding.

## The Market Maker Buy Model Schematic

When we pay attention to the full schematic of a market maker buy model, what I would like you to see is that inside the schematic, you can see that we have our draw on liquidity established right here, original consolidation, sell side of the curve, and we see the market reach your point of interest, which is outlined by this red line.

Notice that the market reaches the point of interest and we then see the market reverse and draw towards the draw on liquidity. It's the buy side of the curve unfolding.

When it comes to these schematics, it's important to understand that on the left side of the curve, there are going to be imbalances which will be formed. These imbalances are going to form the moment that price expands away from a prior retracement. And the reason why this is important is because the left side of the curve determines and influences how the right side of the curve is likely going to deliver.

### The Market Structure Shift Pattern

So what you can see is that I've outlined two blue boxes down here—a lower FVG right here, a lower bearish fair value gap, and one slightly above it. Do you see how the retracement higher which set up that final push lower—this is exactly that fractal which we've just discussed, by the way. Do you see how this high formed inside the FVG on the left side of the curve?

What I would like you to see is that when the market displaces above imbalances which formed on the left side of the curve, I need to see these imbalances function as support on price if we are in a buy program. Therefore, this is a market structure shift pattern which is being set up.

The market structure shift pattern is a pattern in price action which I've coined years ago. And it's the strongest algorithmic signature which you can look for to confirm market reversals. The reason why is because it occurs at the key level.

What I would like you to see is that we see an FVG high. And what I'm then looking for is I'm looking for an imbalance to form inside of this price swing whilst the market trades above this high. If that occurs, I want to see that imbalance function as support on price. I need to see it function as support on price.

But what if I told you that you can already anticipate this market structure shift pattern taking place before it is even formed? Because when the market displaces above this lowest FVG right here, the final bearish fair value gap, it's already a sign of the underlying order flow beginning to change.

## Bearish Market Structure

When we pay attention to bearish market structure, then what I would like you to see is that when it comes to bearish market structure, what we can be looking for is the market to expand higher, form this high, retrace, and then have one more expansion higher. The moment that this swing high forms and we see the market displace below the low which set up this final run above this old high, that is to us the confirmed change in the state of delivery.

A change in the state of delivery can already be confirmed higher up. However, to play it safe, I would like you to start investigating this low being displaced through. The moment that we displace through that low, we would like to see it be utilized as resistance on price, meaning the moment that we displace below this low right here, that's our change in state of delivery confirmed. And we now know price has changed from buy program to sell program.

### Mitigation Blocks and SMT

Now I understand that some of you might be looking at the schematics which I've decided to put in this presentation. You might be thinking to yourself, "But is there always a higher high, or is there always a lower low within the bullish examples?" No. The reason why is because what could happen is that we see a failure swing taking place where a mitigation block is created.

If that occurs, look for intermarket relationships and whether or not the correlated or inversely correlated market actually did that full run, did that full manipulation leg. Because that would be SMT, of course. But in general, the moment that we displace below the low which set up that final run higher, that is to us the change in state of delivery which has taken place.

## Chart Examples and Practice

[The transcript continues with detailed chart examples and Zeussy's personal teaching moments]

### Key Insight About Time Frames

Whenever you do not see any imbalances on the time frame that you're looking at the markets at, zoom into a lower time frame because I promise they're going to be there. And when you extend them to the right, you are going to see their importance.

## Homework Assignment

What I would like you to do now that we've come to the end of this lecture is I would like you to literally go into your charts and I would like you to collect as many examples as possible of a change in the state of delivery taking place.

The way I suggest you to do this is to literally just go to a blank chart. It doesn't matter what market it is, but just go to a blank chart and pay attention to how the left side of the curve influences the right side of the curve within a market reversal. If you start paying attention to the prior steps which I've outlined throughout this Models series as well, you are going to smile.

We're going to expand upon this information moving forward, but I've dropped many gems throughout this lecture and I really suggest you to dive deeper into it.

I want to wish you good work in your studies and look forward to speaking to you soon again. Be safe!
