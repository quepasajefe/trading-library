# Introduction - 2025 model Series

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to the first lecture of the 2025 model series here on the Time and Price mentorship.

This lecture is completely different than all of the previous lectures which you have ever watched on my mentorship. And the reason why is because I wanted to do something special for the first lecture of this 2025 model series. This is the second time that I have come out here on my mentorship platform and have actually decided to put myself in front of a camera to speak to you. The reason why is because for this model series, I want to make sure that I'm establishing a personal connection with you so that I'm able to guide you as best as possible during your development.

## What to Expect

During this video, what I will discuss with you is what you can expect of the model series and also what I expect from you as my student when it comes to making use of the time which you have with me as best as possible. Because my goal is to guide you to become an independent thinker. I want you to investigate what I'm showcasing to you, and I want you to investigate whether or not there's any validity behind everything which I'm sharing with you.

Now, when it comes to the algorithmic theory which I use to trade the financial markets week in, week out, it's very important to understand that it's based upon time and price. If you have gone through the 2024 model series, you have already gotten insights into a great deal of advanced information which provides you with an edge over the other participants within the markets.

However, based upon your feedback on the 2024 model series, I've been able to establish what is basically missing within your understanding right now. The way that I've been able to establish this is by paying attention to the questions which have been asked by you on the mentorship forum. My goal throughout the 2025 model series is to try and simplify all the information which I've shared within the 2024 model series, so even if you did not watch that series yet, you can still make sure that you get to this very advanced level of algorithmic price delivery.

## Course Structure

Now, when it comes to what you can expect from this series, you can expect the following:

You can expect weekly releases of new lectures, meaning every single weekend I release a lecture of the model series. The model series itself is going to consist of foundational lectures that are slowly going to transition into advanced lectures. And paired with the uncensored lectures, you are going to gain insight into the way that I trade all markets—meaning I'm not only going to discuss the short-term trading style which I apply for the index futures, I will also be showcasing to you the swing trades which I'm taking. I'm also going to be showcasing to you the longer-term investment plays which I'm making.

The reason why is because my goal is to show to you that there are so many different ways to go out here and to extract money from the markets. At the end of the day, guys, you need to pick what suits you. I am someone who is capable of trading all different styles because I have mastered these concepts. However, for you, I suggest you first try and master just one style. Focus on either short-term trading, focus on either swing trading, or focus on long-term trading.

To learn exactly how to look at swing trading and long-term trading, you can go through the swing trading series. However, even within the model series, I will bring back elements which I discussed during that series.

## The Reality of Your Journey

Now, when it comes to the journey which you're going to embark on with me, I want you to understand that it's not going to be an easy journey. It's not going to be like, "Oh, you watched the lectures and all of a sudden you come to this great understanding of all time and price together." No, it doesn't work that way, guys.

Some of you think you can just join my mentorship, watch the lectures, and you can go out there next week or next month and just crush it, right? No, that's like—stop thinking that way. Stop thinking that you can just achieve this level of precision that I have within a matter of one week or in a matter of weeks. This takes years of hard work and dedication, meaning you need to be willing to submit to time and you need to be willing to put in the required effort.

The majority of people want to get to a level of success within a matter of months. However, it doesn't work that way. So stop trying to rush your process. Just submit to time and allow growth to take place at the pace that you are going at. Meaning, some of you are able to commit more time than others. Some of you might be working full time, you might be taking care of your family as well, and next to that, you're also trying to learn how to trade.

If that is your situation right now, don't think that you can just go out here and succeed in this business within one month from now. Like guys, do you realize how unrealistic that expectation is that you are basically putting upon yourself? And the amount of pressure which you're putting upon yourself?

## My Advice for the Year Ahead

My main advice to you for the upcoming year is to be patient and allow yourself the time which you need in order to develop. And during that time period that you have given yourself permission to develop, allow yourself to develop by simply focusing on learning. Meaning, don't think that simply because you have watched a few lectures, you can go out here and get a funded challenge and go out here and try to trade. Maybe you will fund your own live accounts, guys.

At the end of the day, what matters is that you're able to get to this level of understanding algorithmic price delivery. When you get to this level of understanding algorithmic price delivery, all that there's left to do is for you to go out there and decide on your own.

## Important Disclaimer

I would never tell you to go out here and trade. I would never tell you to go out here to put risk on the table because I'm not a financial advisor. Nothing I say throughout my mentorship content, or specifically within this model series, should be considered as any form of financial advice. If you think that you can just copy everything I say and make financial decisions based upon that, you are deciding to do so—I'm not suggesting that you should.

Everything which I will share with you is meant for educational purposes only, guys. That means all the content which I release to you is purely my own experience being shared with you for the purpose of education only. If you decide on your own to ever go out there and apply risk to the concepts which I've taught to you, then it's your decision and not mine. And that's something which I am going to continuously mention to you, because I don't want you to just go out there and say, "Look, Zeussy taught me what a breaker looks like, so I'm going to go out here and trade this breaker." No.

## A More Personal Approach

What you will notice as well is that one of the things which I didn't really do throughout 2024 was share my opinions and share my thoughts—I stayed quiet and stayed objective. And that was something which a lot of you appreciated. However, when I showed more of me as who I am—as the person, as who I am as the operator—it actually sparked a connection between me and a lot of you guys. You literally DM me or send me emails saying, "Oh, I would like you to share more of these types of thoughts," or "I would like you to share more of your thought processes when it comes to this type of stuff."

And that is why that's a side of me which you're going to see more and more. The reason why is because I'm looking around the industry which I'm in—the trading industry—and seeing nothing but garbage. I'm seeing people teach others that they can simply go out here and look for price patterns and simply just trade based upon this price pattern and price patterns, and that's it.

When I see that type of stuff, it really frustrates me because I know that that right there is a model which is not complete. There's so much information missing within that one particular model. It's like you're trading literally without any direction in mind. And when you trade that way, it's very easy to get unmotivated because the win rate will be low and you're going to be taking a lot of trades. Whilst in reality, your focus should be on decreasing the amount of trades, defining what a high probability trade setup looks like, and then purely focusing on executing that high probability trade setup.

## What You Will Learn

That is what you are going to learn throughout this 2025 model series. I'm literally going to walk you from step A to step Z through my full protocol, in which you're going to learn, "All right, this is the sequence of events that I'm looking for, and based upon that sequence of events, I can anticipate what the next delivery of price is going to be."

Because you need to understand that all these markets are driven by high-frequency trading algorithms. These high-frequency trading algorithms are coded to operate in a certain manner. Our belief is that when we're able to anticipate—or recognize, I should say—what the function right now is of those high-frequency trading algorithms, we can anticipate what their next function will be. Meaning, based upon their footsteps, we can say, "All right, this is what the next move should be."

And when we're able to come to the conclusion of what the next move should be from point A to point B, we're able to look for an entry opportunity within that direction, with that idea in mind. And that is what gets established by paying attention to certain sequences in both time and price. That is the perspective and paradigm which I'm going to share with you throughout this model series.

## An Enlightening Experience

Now, one of the most important things which I want you to note down is that what you're going to learn throughout this model series is going to be enlightening. It means it's going to be an experience where it's like, "How the hell did I not see this prior?" And that is going to be challenging for some of you because it's going to go against some of your former beliefs which you might have had.

I understand that for some of you, that could be really hard to accept—that what you were taught prior is not the reality behind why price is moving up and down. And I understand that that can be challenging to accept. However, I want you to go into this series with an open mind. I don't want you to believe anything I say. I literally want you to just watch the lectures and investigate on your own whether or not there's any validity behind the things that I'm sharing with you.

## Do Your Own Research

And I'm telling you right now, if you just go into your own charts and you investigate just one week's worth of price action, and you investigate what I'm sharing with you when it comes to time and price, you are going to see these algorithmic signatures again and again and again. And you're going to be like, "Okay, fine, one week—that might have been luck, right? That might have been just one week in which what he shared was there, right?"

However, do that again. And do that another week. And do that another week. And do that another week. And before you know it, you have months' worth of data, maybe even years' worth of data, of the same algorithmic signatures taking place at the exact same—or during the exact same—windows of time, from the exact same points of interest, point A to point B, again and again and again.

## The Confidence You'll Gain

And when you come to that level of understanding, guys—I'm telling you right now, right here within this introduction lecture (and by the way, guys, this is not going to be the style for every lecture, don't worry—this is just for this introduction lecture that I'm out here speaking to you face to face)—but I'm telling you right now, yes, when you begin to see this and begin to see these signs over and over again of high-frequency trading algorithms stepping in during these windows of time, doing this and this and this within price, I'm telling you, you are going to feel a sense of confidence within your own analysis that is literally unseen within the trading industry.

And that is something which you must work towards. And until you get to that level, I want you to simply just grind and grind and grind. And when you eventually arrive, you're going to be grateful for the amount of chart time which you spent in front of the screens.

## The Evolution of Your Trading

Because right now, your focus has to be on studying the lectures, putting in the countless hours, the countless reps of just going into the charts and investigating and investigating and investigating. But the moment you understand how these markets are driven and the moment you can time them with a great deal of precision consistently, your chart time will actually decrease.

You're going to take a step back from the screens. Where you were initially putting in 16 hours a day behind the charts, you will now be able to just say, "Well, if I know that distribution is going to take place around 10 AM, why would I show up at 7 AM? Why not just wait until around 10 AM, come to the charts 15 minutes beforehand, you know, make your pre-market routine—which we're also going to discuss, what my routine is—make a routine and just go to the screens at around 10 AM, trade distribution, boom, be done. Done within less than maybe two hours max."

Yeah, that is what will happen when you are able to see these moves take place before they occur. And that is what I want you to work towards.

## Trying New Things

Now, this style of content is completely new to me. I'm completely new to sitting in front of a camera and speaking to you, and I have no clue how this is going to even look on the platform itself. Like, this is something that's new to me, but I am someone who is willing to try out new things and willing to go out here and just try out what is best.

Is it possible that some of you might not like this style of content and you would much rather prefer just the PowerPoint slides in which I'm just walking through a lecture? Yes, that's possible. However, I know that there are some of you as well that really want to just connect with me more because this is the type of message which you need to hear more. And that is why I'm also going to create more of these type of sit-down videos in which I'm just going to discuss certain topics with you.

## Final Words

Now with that being said, I want to wish you good luck with embarking on the studies of this 2025 model series. I want to wish you good luck with your studies in general. I suggest you to stay on track with following along with the market reviews. The reason why is because you're literally seeing me apply in real time what I'm teaching to you.

And that right there is one of the most beautiful experiences which you can have, where you can see me outline, "Okay, I'm monitoring—for example, in a bullish scenario—I'm looking for the market to draw towards this level. I'm expecting that we're going to run towards that level from this level down here, this point A to this point B." And then you can monitor whether or not the market is effectively delivering this way.

And when you begin to see that week in, week out, and begin thinking about the amount of opportunities that there are throughout this run from point A to point B, you are going to smile and you are going to be amazed by what can be achieved within this industry when you start paying attention to the right details. And that is what I want you to work towards.

So please don't think that you should rush this process. Don't think that you should be there next week or next month. Give yourself time and give yourself the permission to submit to time. Don't think that you should go out here and just rush through it, because I'm telling you—and this is what I've seen within the 2024 mentorship—a lot of people try to rush through the content, and by the end of that series they realized, "Damn, I rushed through it." And then they rewatch it, and then they pick up on new things, and then they're like, "How the hell did I not see that the first time?" It's because you rushed through it.

So slow and steady wins the race—always. And it's the same within trading in general, meaning within this learning phase, you want to give yourself time, and you want to give yourself the time that you need to develop.

And when you finally come to the stage that you decide on your own you're ready for trading in general, that is when the real fun begins. Because then you also realize slow and steady wins the race. Less is more. Less transactions lead to a better result over time if the trades that are being taken are highly probable and lead to high returns. And that is the perspective which I want you to gain.

Be patient, be courageous, and be wise. Good luck, and I look forward to catching up with you in the next episode of this 2025 model series. Be safe.
