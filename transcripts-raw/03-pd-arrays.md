# PD Arrays - 2025 Model Series Lecture 03

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on PD arrays.

## A Different Perspective on PD Arrays

Now before we dive into this lecture, I first want to share with you the following: I understand that many of you have probably already researched the majority of these PD arrays in great detail, meaning you have probably gone into your charts and you've probably investigated breakers and fair value gaps and such. However, during this lecture, I want to share with you a different perspective on PD arrays in general. 

Therefore, I ask you to go into this lecture with an open mind, meaning please understand that the PD arrays as they were taught by ICT are a representation of a certain logic. Because simply looking for these price patterns themselves within the market is not enough. They can only be looked for within a particular framework. And that is why I'm discussing them now in the beginning of this 2025 Models series.

## The Matrix of PD Arrays

Here you can see the matrix of PD arrays. This matrix was originally created by ICT (Inner Circle Trader), and therefore full credit goes out to him for creating these PD arrays.

Before we dive into this schematic right here, I first want you to understand the definition behind PD arrays. **PD arrays are algorithmic signatures within the delivery of price.** Meaning, throughout the delivery of price within buy or sell programs, what will happen is that IPDA will leave behind footsteps. Our job is to recognize what these footsteps are to anticipate what the next delivery function is likely going to be.

When we pay attention to this matrix of PD arrays, what you can see is that within this larger box, which represents a range, there is a premium side and a discount side. What this basically means is that above 50%, you can see that there is a red box which represents the premium side, and below 50%, there's a discount which represents the discount side.

### The Sequence of Premium Arrays (Bearish)

What you can see is that when we pay attention to the premium side first, it begins with an old high/low. Then we see:
1. The rejection block form
2. The bearish order block form
3. The fair value gap form
4. The liquidity void form (we'll get to the liquidity void in a bit because in my opinion, you do not need to pay attention to it)
5. A bearish breaker form
6. A bearish mitigation block form

### The Sequence of Discount Arrays (Bullish)

If we pay attention to the discount side, then what you can see is that it begins on the lower end right here with an old low/high:
1. A rejection block forms
2. A bullish order block
3. A fair value gap
4. A liquidity void (again, this can be ignored, but we'll get to that in a bit)
5. A bullish breaker forms
6. A bullish mitigation block forms

### Understanding the Sequence

Now when you pay attention to the way that I'm describing this matrix of PD arrays, what you can understand is that I'm explaining a specific sequence to you. Meaning, whenever a buy or sell program is in play, what you will see take place is that these PD arrays will form within that sequence. First the rejection block will form, then the order block, then the fair value gap, then the breaker or mitigation block.

When you start investigating this by itself, you're already going to look at PD arrays from a completely different perspective because all of a sudden you begin to look at them from a sequence perspective. The sequence has to be in play in order to anticipate what the next delivery function is likely going to be.

When a lot of people got introduced to any PD array such as, for example, a fair value gap, what they initially think is that they should just go out there and trade every single fair value gap that appears. However, the fair value gap itself is simply a price pattern. The logic which I'm explaining to you now is not based around any price patterns—it's based around understanding A to B, buy or sell program. Are we bullish or bearish? Because once that is defined, you can utilize any of these PD arrays to get into a potential trade.

### A Note on Liquidity Voids

Now, when we pay attention to the liquidity void, then what you can see is that I mentioned already prior that you can kind of ignore this. The reason why is because the liquidity void is basically multiple imbalances forming after each other. Or in other words, multiple fair value gaps forming after each other in a row, and the range of the liquidity void is those multiple imbalances. So for this lecture, we're just going to focus on the fair value gap.

## Premium Arrays (Bearish Patterns)

Now, what I will do with you is I will walk you through all of these specific PD arrays. I'm going to explain the logic behind them. I will first discuss all the premium arrays with you, and then we're going to take a look at the discount arrays.

### Bearish Rejection Block

The sequence of the premium arrays begins with the formation of a bearish rejection block. A bearish rejection block forms when price forms a swing high with a long wick and trades into the wick before rejecting it and drawing lower. The range of the rejection block is the difference between the open or close of the final candle of the swing high formation to the high.

Meaning, inside of this example, what you can see is that price expanded higher and we saw the market then form this long wick. The range of the rejection block is the price range between this candle's close to the high of this candle. Now, please keep in mind that because this is an up-close candle, we pay attention to the close to the high as its respective range. The range is the bearish rejection block. If this candle would be a down-close candle and we would see open high, then the rejection block would be the difference between the opening price and the price of this candle's high. This is our bearish rejection block.

When we pay attention to a chart example, what you can see is that the market formed this high right here and we then saw the market deliver towards the downside. Eventually, the market expanded towards the upside and what you can see is that we took out that old high. Pay attention to what is resting above this high—above this high, buy-side liquidity is resting. So what you must understand is that buy-side liquidity is being taken out. We begin to see the signs of a swing high formation taking place right here.

### Bearish Order Block

When we pay attention to the bearish order block then, this takes place when price runs higher into a point of interest and the up-close candle or sequence of up-close candles that forms is your bearish order block. The moment price crosses the open of the sequence of up-close candles or just the open of that first candle, the change in the state of delivery (CSD) has taken place.

To play it safe, wait for the low of that sequence of up-close candles to be traded below. The reason why is because when you see the market displace below the low which set up the repricing into the point of interest, from that moment in time you can say with confidence, "All right, we have likely formed a high and we're now going to turn around."

The range of the bearish order block is from range low to range high—meaning from the lowest price level to the highest price level of that one up-close candle or sequence of up-close candles which repriced into your point of interest.

What's happening throughout this final run higher into your point of interest is the following: Manipulation is taking place. Buyers are stepping into the marketplace while smart money is being provided the opportunity to go short against those buyers. At the same time, buy-side liquidity is being taken out. Why? Because the market is expanding above old highs which are resting in the past. Therefore, what you're seeing taking place is that those buyers are being trapped into the marketplace while smart money is being provided the opportunity to fill their short orders.

### Fair Value Gap (Bearish)

A fair value gap takes place when price expands into a one-sided direction in a quick manner without retracing to offer efficient delivery. This means price will seek to offer efficient delivery at a later moment in time. Why? Because IPDA's main function is to deliver price in an efficient manner on a time-based schedule.

The fair value gap is the range between the first candle's low and the third candle's high. When we pay attention to the price pattern, what you can see is that there's a difference between the first candle's low right here and the third candle's high—there's a gap right here. There's a lack of buy-side delivery inside of the price range of this middle candle.

If this third candle would have repriced all the way to the low of the first candle, then this price range would have been balanced out. But because that didn't occur, buy-side has to be delivered at a later moment in time to reprice back into that range to deliver efficiently inside of the price range.

### Bearish Breaker

The bearish breaker forms when a bullish order block sets up a run above buy-side liquidity, followed by displacement lower, causing the bullish order block to become an inversed bullish order block. Price will seek to reprice into the price range of the bearish breaker before expanding lower.

What this basically means is the following: When the market expanded towards the upside and it repriced, and we then saw this low form, the market expanded higher once more. This low set up the final expansion higher into a hard-timed point of interest, followed by a reversal which originated from that point of interest.

When it comes to the delivery which takes place throughout this retracement lower followed by the expansion higher, this is a fractal market maker buy model. And inside of this fractal of sell-side and buy-side delivery, you will see a down-close candle form which set up the final run higher. This down-close candle got utilized by smart money to buy off of to target buy-side liquidity resting above this high.

The moment that the market displaces below this down-close candle (below this low right here), the final down-close candle which formed right here is your bearish breaker. And that down-close candle has to function as resistance on price in order for the order flow to remain bearish.

### Bearish Mitigation Block

A bearish mitigation block forms when a bullish order block sets up a run higher but does NOT take out buy-side liquidity, followed by displacement lower, causing the bullish order block to become an inversed bullish order block. Price will seek to reprice into the price range of the bearish mitigation block before expanding lower.

The price pattern of a bearish mitigation block is very similar to the price pattern of that bearish breaker. The only difference is the following: The only difference is that the bearish mitigation block does not set up a run above the high before the low formation takes place. Notice that the market expanded higher, but it formed a lower high relative to this high. Therefore, the moment that price trades below this low, we expect that this final down-close candle is going to function as resistance on price because it's going to function as a bearish mitigation block.

## Discount Arrays (Bullish Patterns)

We're now going to be paying attention to the discount arrays, and as outlined with the premium arrays, the discount arrays begin with the rejection block creation.

### Bullish Rejection Block

A rejection block gets created when price forms a swing low with a long wick and price trades into the wick before rejecting it and drawing higher. The range of the rejection block is the difference between the open or close to the low.

Inside this example, what you can see is that a swing low forms where you can see that there are three candles next to each other. Notice that the candle in the middle took out the low of the previous candle. Notice that the price range between the close of this candle to the wick (to the low) is annotated and highlighted by this wide range right here. This wick is our bullish rejection block, and therefore, as long as price does not take out this low, we can anticipate that we're likely going to see the market begin to draw towards the upside soon.

### Bullish Order Block

A bullish order block takes place when price runs lower into a point of interest and the down-close candle or sequence of down-close candles get traded above. This sequence of down-close candles inside this example is your bullish order block.

The moment that price crosses the open of the sequence of down-close candles or that one down-close candle, the change in the state of delivery (CSD) is taking place. To play it safe and to confirm your CSD, I suggest waiting for the high of that sequence of down-close candles to be traded above. The range of the bullish order block is from high to low—from this high to this low.

Here comes the tip: Whenever the price range of the full bullish order block is rather large (meaning from this high to this low), what you can pay attention to is the range of purely the bodies—meaning you can ignore the wicks then. Why? Because the wicks do the damage whilst the bodies tell you the story.

So as a general rule of thumb, whenever you see a large bullish order block form, pay attention to mainly the bodies. When the bullish order block isn't that large and it's a rather small order block, you can annotate the full range from low to high.

### Fair Value Gap (Bullish)

The fair value gap forms on the bullish side when price expands into a one-sided direction in a quick manner without retracing to offer efficient delivery. This means that price will seek to offer efficient delivery at a later moment in time.

The fair value gap is the range between the first candle's high and the third candle's low. When we pay attention to a chart example, what you can see is that the first candle reprices higher, the second candle then expands towards the upside quickly, and notice that the third candle opens up and it drops lower but does not reach the first candle's high. Therefore, there's a lack of sell-side delivery which is now present inside of this range. That means that there is a bullish fair value gap which has been created, and the market will seek to reprice into that bullish fair value gap before it's allowed to expand towards the upside.

Now there are scenarios in which these fair value gaps are allowed to stay open, but then we're speaking about the breakaway gaps, and they require a lecture by themselves in the future of this Models series. Right now your focus is on recognizing the pattern of the fair value gap.

### Bullish Breaker

When a bearish order block sets up a run below sell-side liquidity followed by displacement higher, a bearish order block will be turning into an inversed bearish order block. The reason why this is happening is because, just like I outlined to you within the bearish examples within the premium array creations, we're looking at that final run lower right here to be manipulation.

What's happening here is the following: The market is dropping lower, sell-side liquidity gets engineered, a retracement higher takes place, and we then see the market drop lower one more time, taking out sell-side liquidity below this low, reaching a point of interest. The moment that the market displaces above this high, we anticipate that the final up-close candle which formed throughout this final run lower (or which set up this final run lower, I should rather say), we anticipate that this up-close candle has to function as support on price because this up-close candle is your bullish breaker.

What will happen is that price will seek to reprice into the price range of the bullish breaker before expanding higher. This is the entry opportunity which I will show to you throughout this Models series, because once you start understanding when and where this setup presents itself, it's going to unlock a completely new perspective on all financial markets. Because this right here is, in my opinion, the most straightforward trading setup which you can look for. There are very clear rules which apply to it. It's not simply the price pattern of a bullish breaker, just like with any other of the previous PD arrays which I've shown throughout this lecture so far, but it's the underlying logic behind when and why they should work.

### Bullish Mitigation Block

The bullish mitigation block forms when a bearish order block sets up a run lower but does NOT take out sell-side liquidity, followed by displacement higher, causing the bearish order block to become an inversed bearish order block. Price will seek to retrace into the price range of the bullish mitigation block before expanding higher.

What you see inside of this schematic is that the market expanded lower, forms this low, retraces, and we then see the market have one more push lower. But notice that where the bullish breaker took out sell-side liquidity engineered below this low, you can see that the bullish mitigation block does not take out sell-side liquidity resting below this low. Therefore, the moment that we see this displacement above this high, it confirms to you that we have in fact formed a low, and now this final up-close candle which set up this retracement can get utilized as a potential buying opportunity throughout the next retracement. This is your bullish mitigation block, and this range can be utilized as a potential entry opportunity.

## The Complete Framework

When we pay attention to that PD array matrix one more time, what you can see is that within this schematic I've now replaced where the A and B are. Notice that A is now on the bottom left and B is on the top right. What you can see is that just like outlined with regards to the bearish example of the premium array creations, you can see that there is a sequence to the creation of the discount arrays. Therefore, your job is to investigate whether or not you're able to recognize this sequence.

What these letters basically showcase to you is the following: What they show to you is what I outlined to you throughout the price cycle lecture, in which I outlined to you that every single price swing has an inception price and a terminus—an end price. Our job is to align ourselves with the delivery which is taking place between point A to point B.

But when we pay attention to this PD array matrix, what you can see is that we can recognize when that move from point A to point B is taking place, when we recognize the sequence in which these arrays are forming—because each array is forming after each other. And that right there should be a major light bulb for the majority of you.

Where instead of chasing patterns for the sake of chasing patterns, you're now beginning to understand that there's a certain order in which you can look for these patterns. And when all these patterns are forming in the right order, and you're trading within a bigger framework, and you're trading within, for example, a market maker sell model, then you know that you have a high probability short trade opportunity.

## Final Thoughts

Now understand that for many of you, watching this lecture at one go might not be good, and the reason why is because I discussed a lot and I discussed a lot of different perspectives on concepts which you already got introduced to probably in the past. Therefore, you must investigate whether or not there's any validity behind the statements which I'm making throughout this lecture.

Because at the end of the day, your job is to see whether or not the validity is there behind what I'm explaining to you. And the way you come to that conclusion is by going into your charts and investigating whether or not you're able to see these PD arrays. When you start blending that with what I've discussed prior with regards to time and price cycles, it will already open up a completely different world for you when it comes to your perspective on the markets.

And with that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that this lecture has provided you with more insights on PD arrays, and I look forward to catching up with you in the next lecture of the 2025 Models series. Good luck with your studies, and I invite you to go into the charts and test whether or not you're able to see this sequence again and again. Be safe, and I look forward to speaking to you in the next episode.
