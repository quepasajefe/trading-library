# Price Cycles - 2025 Model Series Lecture 01

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to the first real lecture of the 2025 model series here on the Time and Price mentorship. This lecture is going to be about one of the most looked-after concepts within my mentorship, and it's called price cycles. During this lecture, I will share with you what a price cycle is, and I will explain to you how we can utilize this logic within the markets. Buckle up because this lecture is going to be game-changing when it comes to your perspective on the markets in general.

## Introduction and Expectations

Now, before we dive into this lecture, I want to share with you that even if you're completely new to my mentorship, you will find great benefit in this lecture. I will try to keep everything as simple as possible whilst also making sure that the knowledge which I'm sharing with you is very advanced. 

Meaning, I will share with you throughout the 2025 model series very advanced trading concepts. However, I will also show you how to simplify these concepts because, at the end of the day, you want to have a trading approach—a model—which is very straightforward to follow and very simple to follow. You don't want to have a very complicated model to follow, and that is what the goal is of this 2025 model series. By the end of this model series, I promise you that you'll have a perspective on the markets that's absolutely unseen, and you will understand time and price to a level that you cannot even imagine right now.

All that I ask of you to do is the following: I ask you to go into all of these lectures with an open mind and with no preconceived notions about why price is doing what it's doing. Please don't believe anything which I'm sharing with you. I want you to literally go into your own charts and look for what I'm showing to you, because at the end of the day, you must see it for yourself. I know it's there. I know that these algorithmic signatures are in front of you, hidden in plain sight. However, it's now up to you to go out there and investigate that.

So pay attention to these lectures, take proper notes. I would even suggest taking screenshots of the schematics which I will be providing throughout this model series and move from there. So with that being said, let's begin with the first real lecture of the 2025 model series on price cycles.

## Understanding Price Cycles: Point A to Point B

Here we can see a schematic, and on this schematic you can see that I've drawn a box with two points of text. First of all, the point A right here and the point B. 

When it comes to price cycles, you must understand that IPDA is flowing along multiple delivery profiles throughout each day, throughout each week, throughout each month, throughout each year, etc. Our job is to recognize when a new delivery profile or a new delivery function is in play. That means that what we need to recognize is where point A is taking place and where point B is likely going to take place—or in other words, where the inception of a new price swing (in this case a bullish price swing) is going to take place, and where the terminus is, where this bullish price swing is going to end.

Because the way I want you to start looking at the markets is through the following perspective: I want you to start looking at the markets through the perspective of recognizing expansions. When you can recognize expansions before they occur, the lower timeframes are going to be magical to you because you will see exactly where IPDA is accumulating, manipulating, and distributing. And that right there is what our focus is going to be on throughout this 2025 model series.

When I come to the charts, all I'm looking for is to determine where point A is (where the inception of a new price swing is) and where the terminus of this price swing will be.

## Price Levels and Programs

While we add something to this chart, you can see that I've added lines to this schematic. The reason why I've added the lines to this schematic is due to the following: These lines represent specific price levels, and that means whenever we come to the charts, we must know that there are price levels which IPDA will refer to. These price levels will tell us whether or not IPDA is in a buy or sell program.

When IPDA is in a buy program, we will be looking for buying opportunities. When IPDA is in a sell program, we will be looking for selling opportunities.

### What a Buy Program Looks Like

However, what does a buy program look like in the first place? Well, a buy program looks like the following: What you anticipate is that the market is going to run through these levels which have been plotted on the chart right here, and it's likely going to displace above them and utilize those same levels as support as price reprices towards point B (the terminus). Therefore, what we look to capitalize on is the move from point A to point B.

Does that mean you need to enter at point A? No, it doesn't. As long as you're able to enter below equilibrium of your expected expansion leg (the expansion leg from point A to point B) and you use proper stop loss placement, you can capitalize on the move which is taking place right here. 

Please note that when I say "equilibrium of the expected range," I'm basically saying to you: when you recognize where the original consolidation is (which is your draw on liquidity) and you recognize that the smart money reversal was in right here, you literally only need to look for an entry opportunity in a discount of that range if you're bullish, of course.

## Price Distortion and Level Reactions

What I anticipate when I see that point A has formed (meaning when that buy program has taken off) is the following: I'm expecting that the market is going to reprice towards the first level right here, and when it displaces through that level, I anticipate that same level to function as support on price. Meaning, I do not want to see the market displace through that level. 

Surely it can trade just below it, like you see right here for example, or it can just stop right in advance of it. This is what I refer to as price distortion, and this is a concept which is basically the following: Whenever we have specific price levels that we are monitoring, you must understand that we must allow for some room for the market to trade either above or below the levels but still remain in the same program.

The reason why is because you will not see these levels function exactly as support or resistance all the time. Sometimes a wick will go through it, and that is something we must allow for. The wick which goes below that specific level which we're monitoring is referred to as price distortion.

When the market then expands higher, we are looking for the same signatures that confirm to us, "Yes, IPDA is still in a buy program." And whenever this buy program is taking place, what we can anticipate is that the market is going to continue expanding higher until it reaches point B right here.

## Trading Between Inception and Terminus

Now, I've already shared a lot within those few sentences which I've just shared with you. Let me clarify: Our focus is on recognizing point A right here. When we have defined point A (the beginning of our buy program) and we know what the market is drawn towards (which is point B), what we're basically doing is the following: We're trading between the move from inception to terminus.

Whenever we have defined what this expansion leg is going to be like, we can anticipate that the market is going to continue expanding higher until it reaches point B. It's going to work through the levels, if you will. That means that we can anticipate that when the market displaces higher, we're likely going to see the market find support inside of these lines which have been plotted.

However, sometimes the market will just go outside of the lines. You will see it get above it, and you might think to yourself, "Oh, this is already—the market is displacing into that new range," but instead it rejects and then it begins to run. Therefore, what we pay attention to is where our premium and discount arrays are forming. So that means we pay attention to the arrays in the sense of how the market is delivering around these levels which we're monitoring.

## The Perspective Shift

Now, this is of course a conceptual idea which I'm outlining to you during this first lecture of the 2025 model series. The reason why I'm outlining this to you right now already within this new model series is due to the following: This is the perspective which I want you to begin having when looking at the markets.

So that means instead of looking at price patterns, you must be looking at the markets through the lens of "What is the current program that we're in?" In this case, you can see a buy program, and it all gets confirmed the moment that you see point A be confirmed. Whenever you have confirmed that a swing low has formed and you have confirmed that we're now in this buy program, you can anticipate until when the buy program will last. And this, of course, is also where trade management plays a crucial role.

By the end of this model series, you will know exactly how you can navigate the institutional order flow by looking at the markets through this perspective. That means you'll be paying attention to the reactions to specific price levels across all markets—meaning not just on the index futures, but also on forex, commodities, or even crypto.

Because even though I don't trade crypto myself, there are still a lot of traders within my mentorship that do trade crypto, and they're outlining to me that the same concepts work there. The reason why they work there is because, from a different perspective than what the masses have, I view the markets through the lens of them all being rigged. Meaning, I believe that there's a lot of money which flows through all of these markets out here, and that money is not just being thrown around randomly.

## Bearish Schematic

When we pay attention to a bearish schematic, then what you can see is that we have literally just inversed the placement of point A and point B. Because in a bearish example, what we would be monitoring is the following: What we would be monitoring is how the market is delivering within this sell program from point A right here to point B. Meaning, we recognize that a swing high (a smart money reversal) has formed up here within a market maker sell model, and therefore we can anticipate that the market is going to expand towards the downside towards point B—inception to terminus.

Whenever we have determined that inception of this sell program has taken place, we can enter anywhere above equilibrium of this range. Meaning, as long as we enter in a premium of the expected expansion leg which is going to take place, we can find ourselves in a profitable trade.

Because the moment that that smart money reversal takes place inside of point A right here, what's happening is that high-frequency trading algorithms are firing in shorts. That means they're working through the levels and taking it one level at a time. The reason why this is occurring is because they must reprice towards point B (the terminus), and that means that we can anticipate that all these levels which have been drawn within the schematic are going to get displaced through and function as resistance on price.

It's possible that the market is going to go, for example, below the level as you can see here, and then go slightly above it, and then run lower. What is that? The movement just above this level right here is called price distortion, and that is something you must allow for. That's also why when it comes to trade management, you will see that we cannot just say, "I'm going to place my stop loss one point above this price level right here, which is for example a full 100 number." No, because we must allow for the market to reprice just slightly above it, trap people into believing higher prices are next, and then drop it lower significantly.

## PD Arrays and Anticipation

Now, when it comes to PD arrays and such, what you will learn eventually is that the creation of PD arrays can be anticipated the moment that you recognize that the absolute high (the smart money reversal) was in. Meaning, you can anticipate in what order all PD arrays—all premium and discount arrays—will be created.

Since this lecture is still just a foundational lecture to the overall model which I will be teaching to you within this 2025 model series, I will not go into that too much yet, because I must first make sure that you understand the overlying premise through which I'm looking at the markets.

When I look at the markets and I'm expecting lower prices to come, I'm looking at where is point A (meaning where is the swing high formation) and where is the market likely going to draw towards right here. That is the draw on liquidity. That is the terminus of the sell program. Terminus is already predefined before we even see the swing high formation, and that's a key insight to have.

## High-Frequency Trading and Resistance Runs

But when it comes to the fact that we see that swing high formation taking place and we begin to see that sell program unfolding, what's actually occurring is the following: Every single key level is getting displaced through because high-frequency trading algorithms are doing one thing—they're firing in shorts. That could either lead to very quick repricing lower (this is a low resistance liquidity run), but in other environments, what you could see is that the market is just going through these levels at a very slow pace, where it's consolidating, where it's going back and forth, where it's taking a lot of time before it expands towards our draw on liquidity.

Our focus has to be on recognizing environments in which we can expect low resistance liquidity runs to take place. The reason why is because when you find yourself taking part in a low resistance liquidity run, it will feel just awesome. And for those of you that have already traded in the past, you know what it feels like where you enter and the market immediately expands into your favor. These types of environments can be recognized, and they can be anticipated in advance.

Wouldn't it make sense for you to focus purely on trading in the low resistance liquidity run environments over the high resistance liquidity run environments? Don't get me wrong—we can still find setups within high resistance liquidity run environments. But think of it through this perspective: Would you much rather enter and exit within a matter of less than an hour or maybe two hours? Or would you much rather sit in a trade just for hours in a row before it finally begins to expand in your favor?

Of course, you would choose to focus on the low resistance liquidity run environments. I don't believe that there's anyone that would choose to rather—I really don't. If you would prefer to sit in consolidations and wait and wait and wait for the market to expand, you're unique, and I don't believe you should strive to trade in those environments. You want to be there where the technical precision is the highest.

## Understanding Price Cycles

What you will come to realize is that what I'm outlining to you here, when it comes to the logic of point A to point B, I'm outlining to you literally how IPDA is repricing through the price ranges as I'm outlining them to you. Meaning, what we're seeing is that the price cycle is the following:

**The price cycle is the process from point A to point B in which you're going to see every single bearish signature which you will learn throughout this 2025 model series.**

And when it comes to the bullish example, it's exactly the same but inversed, where the bullish price cycle is the movement from the point A to the point B within that buy program.

When you recognize what the current price cycle is and you recognize where the market is going to draw towards, you can enter anywhere in a premium or discount of that anticipated expansion-like range, as long as you use proper stop loss placement.

## Looking Forward

This lecture has shown to you how you can look at the markets through the perspective of levels. Later on within the 2025 model series, I will teach you exactly how you can find what the levels to use within the markets that you're looking at. That means we'll be looking at both index futures and forex, but we'll even look at some other markets such as commodities, and we might even throw some crypto in there if you guys want to.

Because the thing is, this logic applies to all markets. Meaning, literally, if you would be looking at investing into stocks, you will see the same level of technical precision across all timeframes, guys. Literally, what you will be introduced to throughout this series is a level of technical precision that is not found anywhere else. And you are going to be amazed by the fact that you are going to see the same algorithmic signatures being present—not only on the higher timeframes in the form of, for example, monthly or weekly timeframes, but also on one-minute and sub-minute timeframes.

The reason why is because there's always a price cycle in play. Meaning, price is always a part of a market maker model, and all you need to focus on is recognizing point A to point B.

## Fractal Nature of Markets

The final thing which I want to introduce to you throughout this first lecture of this 2025 model series—and when I say first lecture, I mean the first real lecture (of course I recorded an introduction lecture, but that's different, that's not like a real educational lecture as part of the model series)—this is the first lecture in which I'm introducing theory to you.

What I want you to understand is that this schematic right here can be a very big range which we're monitoring. Inside of that big range, you can see expansions lower followed by retracements higher, followed by expansions lower. Do you understand that this high right here can be your point A and this low right here can be your point B? That's a fractal market maker sell model. That's a sell program which is taking place.

The same right here: point A, this low point B. Point A, this low point B. Point A, this low point B.

What defines a high probability trade setup is when you're able to align all the cycles with each other—not only the price cycles but also within time cycles.

## Next Steps

During the next lecture of the model series, I will introduce you to the concept of time cycles. That will solidify your understanding of time to make sure that you are able to align time and price.

I know that many of you did not expect this lecture to be the first lecture of the 2025 model series when it comes to the topic which I introduced to you today. However, I really look forward to seeing all the charts on the mentorship forum coming in where you're paying attention to defining point A and point B.

When point B gets reached, you wait for more market data. You never go out here and say, "Oh, now we must turn around," because what can happen is that the market is just going to expand beyond where you anticipated the buy program or sell program (in this example) to stop. Therefore, be content with enough, because you will see that there are plenty of opportunities each week utilizing this logic.

I look forward to speaking to you in the next episode, and during the next episode I will introduce you to the concept of time cycles and I will introduce you to how we can begin to look at the markets from a time perspective.

Good work with your studies, and I look forward to seeing the charts come in. Be safe.
