# Time Cycles - 2025 Model Series Lecture 02

Hello there, I hope that you are doing well. Welcome to this new lecture of the 2025 Models series. This lecture is going to be on time cycles. Buckle up.

## The Foundation: Time and Price Alignment

First of all, I want to bring attention to the following text with you:

**Time without price means nothing. Price without time also means nothing. But when they align, it yields great precision.**

Meaning, if you're too focused on purely time, you're ignoring price. If you're too focused on purely price, you're ignoring time. However, when you start ignoring one or the other, what you're actually doing is you're decreasing the probabilities of you being able to make an objective analysis.

Why? Because both time and price are the only two objective variables which we can truly deem to be constant within the markets. And therefore, our job is to align them, because when both time and price tell us the same story, we can anticipate with a high degree of confidence that we are likely going to see a specific scenario unfold within the markets. Therefore, blending time and price leads to great precision.

## Understanding Time Cycles

Let us take a look at some theory first of all when it comes to time cycles.

On the screen right here, you can see that I've plotted three boxes. Each one of these boxes represents a specific window of time. I refer to these windows of time as time cycles.

What is very important to note is that these time cycles have a fixed start and a fixed end that does not change. Meaning, if you're looking at, for example, daily cycles, you're paying attention to the days from midnight to midnight. Therefore, the days of, for example, Monday—all Mondays are going to have the exact same time, all Tuesdays are going to have the exact same time, all Wednesdays are going to have the exact same time. 

However, the same applies to, for example, if you're paying attention to weekly cycles. If this would be week one, for example, while the week begins at the Sunday open and ends at the Friday's close, the same applies to week two and the same applies to week three. This right here will never change, guys. And that's very important that you understand that these time cycles are fixed, meaning they will never be adjusted.

## How Time Cycles Determine Delivery

Now, when it comes to these time cycles, what's important to note is that each time cycle determines how the next time cycle is going to deliver. Meaning, cycle one determines how cycle two is going to deliver, and cycle two determines how cycle three is going to deliver.

Throughout each new time cycle, we refer back to the previous cycle's delivery. Meaning, during cycle two, we refer back to cycle one's delivery to monitor where the previous cycle high and low formed. And the same, of course, applies to cycle three relative to cycle two.

The reason why we pay attention to how the previous cycle delivered is because based upon how the previous cycle delivered, we can anticipate how the current and next cycle are likely going to deliver. So when we pay attention to these cycles, they provide you with an objective roadmap that can guide you throughout navigating the financial markets.

This theory applies to all markets. Doesn't matter if you trade index futures, it doesn't matter if you trade forex, it doesn't matter if you trade commodities, it doesn't matter if you trade crypto—these time cycles apply in all markets.

Does that mean they are clean across all markets? No. However, that means that you need to pick which markets you are interested in. There's a reason why I purely focus on the indices—on the index futures—because right now at the time of this recording, early 2025, they are the cleanest. However, in the future, this might change and then I might have to adapt what markets I'm looking at.

## AMD: Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution

When we pay attention to the time cycles, each time cycle has its own respective function, meaning it either accumulates or it manipulates or it distributes.

As the text right here suggests, **your focus should be on recognizing manipulation to anticipate distribution**. Meaning, these time cycles do not only have a function, but that function is not fixed—meaning the time cycles themselves are fixed, however, the function of the time cycle changes, meaning they shift.

So that means sometimes you are going to see accumulation take place perfectly throughout the first time cycle, manipulation throughout the second, and distribution throughout the third. However, there will be instances in which the accumulation is going to last throughout, for example, the first and second time cycle, then the third cycle will manipulate, and then the fourth cycle is going to distribute.

So what is very important to notice is that your focus has to be on recognizing the manipulation, because once you are able to recognize the manipulation, you can anticipate the distribution to unfold afterwards.

## Two Ways to Gauge Order Flow

There are two ways to gauge order flow using time cycles.

### 1. Purge and Revert

First of all, you can pay attention to the purge and revert. The purge and revert is basically when, within a bullish market, we see the market open a new time cycle, drop lower, taking out that previous cycle low (which we have determined by looking back, of course). That sell-side liquidity gets taken out right here, and we then see the market form a low and it begins reversing to draw towards the opposing side of liquidity—towards the previous cycle high. Why? Because above that previous cycle high, a lot of buy-side liquidity has been engineered.

Within a bearish scenario, what you will see is the following: What you will see is that the market opens high, takes out the previous cycle high, takes out the buy-side liquidity which was resting above this high, and we then see a reversal taking place and the market begins to draw towards the opposing side of liquidity, which is resting below the previous cycle low.

This right here is what I absolutely love to see. I like purges and reverts, and the reason why is because it's inside of this drop lower (if bullish) that a lot of retail-minded traders are going to turn overly bearish, and I'm buying against that. If I'm bearish for the session or day or week, of course, I'm looking for an open high because it's in this process that a lot of retail-minded traders are going to turn overly bullish throughout this final run higher, and that is what we're looking to short against.

Because what we're looking for is looking for manipulation to anticipate distribution.

### 2. Continuation Through Levels

Looking back to the previous schematic, another possibility is that when a time cycle's respective high or low gets taken out, we see continuation take place. Meaning, when a new time cycle opens up and we're bullish, we're expecting that the market is going to be repriced above the previous cycle high, and then we anticipate that previous cycle high will function as support on price.

If we would be bearish, it would look the opposite, where we would be looking for lower prices and we would be looking for the market to drop below the previous cycle low. And from that moment in time, we anticipate that the previous cycle low is going to function as resistance on price so that the order flow can continue to be bearish.

Now, one thing which I want you to look at when you go into your charts is the following: I want you to look for a very specific algorithmic signature by IPDA. The algorithmic signature which I want you to look for is the following: I want you to look for an imbalance to displace through that previous cycle high or through that previous cycle low, because it's in that imbalance that you're going to see true support turn resistance or true resistance turn support. That's a key insight.

## Understanding the Time Cycle Hierarchy

Now I understand that so far you're probably like, "All right, this is all fun and games. You explained the theory behind time cycles. You explained how to look at them, how to gauge the order flow. However, you haven't explained yet what the exact timings are." And some of you are now probably like, "How do you know this?" You're reading my mind. Don't worry, I will get to that in a bit.

### Yearly Delivery

Here we can see the yearly delivery, and we are constantly going to refer back to the same schematics which I have provided already. Meaning, if we pay attention to the yearly delivery, you can see that January determines how February will deliver, February determines how March will deliver, and throughout each new month—so throughout February, we refer to the high and low of January; throughout March, we refer to the high and low of February.

Now I didn't want to put the full 12 months in within this schematic, but this logic applies to literally the full 12 months of the year. And therefore you could also, for example, say, "All right, let's look at April, May, June," or, for example, as an example within these schematics. So be flexible when it comes to the time cycles which you're looking at, but to basically make it more easy for me to explain this concept to you, I've just focused on January to March.

When we pay attention to a chart example, you can see that I have however outlined different months, and the reason why is because I want to show to you that this theory applies across all months of the year. What you can see right here is that I've highlighted the months of July until November.

And what you can see is that throughout the month of July, we saw the market ripple. It was dropping aggressively towards the downside. We saw a very quick expansion towards the downside. The fact that the month of July was so bearish right here sets the stage for the following: It sets the stage for a high resistance liquidity run towards the upside.

Why? Because whenever there's a quick run on the left side of the curve, you can anticipate that what will happen is that IPDA is going to go through that from a whipsaw perspective where it's going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth—aka high resistance liquidity run.

So what you see is that August opens low, takes out the July low, and then begins to reverse and retrace into the July range. Notice that we see the market open up for the month of September. What happens? Open low, and we see the market run higher. October consolidates, and then November expands higher, drawing towards July high.

### Monthly Delivery

When we pay attention to the monthly delivery then, what you can see is that the monthly delivery begins from week one and ends by week four. What you can see is that week one determines how week two will deliver. Throughout week two, we refer to the high and low of week one. Week two will determine how week three will deliver. Meaning, throughout week three, we pay attention to the high and low of week two. Throughout week three, we anticipate that we can know how week four is going to deliver. Throughout week four, we pay attention to the high and low of week three.

Now when we pay attention to the monthly delivery in general and we pay attention to what news events are given each new month, it is important to note that throughout the first week of each new month, we have the NFP release. And I've discussed this as well within the Predicting Price series. So if you have not watched that series yet, I highly suggest you do watch that.

But when it comes to NFP and its importance on the monthly profile, it's the following: Because NFP is present throughout the first week of each new month, you must understand that this right here sets the stage for the full sequence for the month to come. Meaning, week one determines how week two will deliver, week two determines how week three will deliver, etc. And therefore, paying attention to how this first week delivers is very important for understanding the full sequence within time.

### Weekly Delivery

When we pay attention to the weekly delivery within a regular week, that begins on Monday. The only reason why I say that a regular week begins on Mondays is because when we have a bank holiday on Monday, I would argue that Tuesday is actually the first day to monitor of the week.

But in general terms, within a regular week, Monday sets the stage for Tuesday, and on Tuesday we refer to the high and low of Monday. Tuesday then sets the stage for Wednesday, and throughout Wednesday we refer to the high and low of Tuesday. Wednesday sets the stage for Thursday, and throughout Thursday we refer to the high and low of Wednesday. And Thursday sets the stage for Friday, and throughout Friday we refer to the high and low of Thursday.

So what you can see is that each new day we pay attention to, "Okay, how did the previous day deliver? Or how did the previous days deliver? What is the story which is currently being told? Where is the liquidity resting?" Because once you're able to frame the proper narrative and you're able to define where the liquidity is resting, what you will be looking for is you will be looking for manipulation into the opposing direction of your anticipated draw on liquidity, and then you can anticipate that distribution will take place afterwards.

## Daily Session Breakdown

When we pay attention to the daily delivery, then what you can see is that the daily delivery begins with the Asia session right here and ends with the afternoon session. All the timings which I've provided right here are in New York time. On TradingView, you can change on the bottom right of your charts your time to New York time, and that is something which I suggest you to do to be aligned with what I'm teaching to you.

What you can see is that:
- The Asia session begins at 6 PM and ends at 2:30 AM
- The London session begins at 2:30 AM and ends at 7 AM
- The New York morning session begins at 7 AM and ends at 11:30 AM
- The afternoon session begins at 11:30 AM and ends at 4 PM

Now again, as has been the whole foundation of this lecture: Asia sets the stage for London. Throughout London, we refer to the high and low of Asia. London sets the stage for the New York morning session. Throughout the New York morning session, we refer to the high and low of London. And the New York morning session sets the stage for the afternoon session. Throughout the afternoon session, we pay attention to the high and low of the New York morning session.

Now one thing which is important to note is that even though I have just been mentioning the previous time cycle with respect to highs and lows, we also pay attention to the highs and lows of even further time cycles in the past. So throughout the afternoon session, you can be referring to the London high and low, for example, or throughout the New York morning session, you can be referring to the Asia high and low, for example. Don't forget about those levels.

And that is why I suggest you to use a time cycle indicator, which I've provided on the mentorship platform, which helps you significantly with determining where the time-based liquidity pools are.

## London Session 90-Minute Cycles

When we pay attention to the London session and its 90-minute cycles, then what you can see is that the London session begins at 2:30 AM and the first 90-minute cycle is between 2:30 AM to 4:00 AM. This is the accumulation cycle. The second cycle of the London session is from 4:00 AM to 5:30 AM, and the third cycle is from 5:30 to 7:00 AM.

I refer to the first cycle as London 1, the second cycle as London 2, and the third cycle as London 3. This is just a terminology thing, guys. And this is how I like to explain to you what I'm seeing within the markets, because you need to understand that what I'm trying to show to you is that there's an objective method of looking at the markets.

Notice that I haven't even discussed a breaker or a fair value gap or whatever entry pattern you might be using, or whatever indicator you might have been using—FVG, VWAP, and all the other retail concepts out there. You need to understand that at the end of the day, there's a framework in play which leads to all those things working, and that framework is what I'm showcasing to you now. This is time.

## Morning Session 90-Minute Cycles

When we pay attention to the morning session and its respective 90-minute cycles then, what you can see is that the morning session begins at 7 AM and ends at 11:30 AM. Notice that within this window of time, we can find three 90-minute cycles.

I already know that there are going to be questions about how did you come up with these 90-minute cycles? How did you figure it out? How did you know what these cycles were?

My mentor, the Inner Circle Trader, has been using these 90-minute cycles for a very long time, and the way I realized that is by the following: My mentor ICT, he was hinting in plain sight that there were specific elements in time that could provide you with a very objective manner of looking at the markets, because IPDA is coded to refer to time cycles, but also price cycles.

What he mentioned multiple times was that at 8:30 AM, a new 90-minute cycle begins. So that right there was already the first element of time that provided us with the opportunity to say, "Okay, well, if at 8:30 AM a new 90-minute cycle begins, that means that between 8:30 to 10, there's a 90-minute window of time. Next time cycle is going to be 10 to 11:30. Next cycle is going to be 11:30 to 1, etc."

When ICT then came out and mentioned his final silver bullet time—7 to 8:30 AM—the full circle was completed. And the reason why was because it's very random, so to say, right, that he has been hinting at 8:30 AM as a crucial opening time all this time. And then all of a sudden his final silver bullet time comes out and it's the 7 to 8:30 AM 90-minute cycle. When you then pair this understanding with the understanding of AMD (accumulation, manipulation, and distribution), you begin to understand the true logic behind these time cycles. And when you investigate them, you are going to smile.

So what you can see is that:
- 7 to 8:30 AM is your first 90-minute cycle. This is what I refer to as AM1
- AM1 sets the stage for AM2, the second 90-minute cycle between 8:30 to 10 AM
- Throughout AM2, we refer to the high and low of AM1
- AM2 is going to set the stage for AM3, meaning throughout AM3, we can anticipate the delivery which will take place based upon how the previous 90-minute cycle delivered
- Throughout AM3, we refer to the high and low of AM2
- AM3 lasts from 10 AM until 11:30 AM

## 30-Minute Cycles Within Sessions

When we pay attention to 30-minute cycles then within the morning session, I just wanted to discuss this because I've already mentioned 30-minute cycles prior throughout this lecture. I just want to make sure that you had a visual idea of them as well.

Please note that these 30-minute cycles are present within each 90-minute cycle of the morning session, also of the London session, also of the New York afternoon session.

Now before we dive into them, I just want to mention to you that you might be wondering, "Zeussy, why don't you discuss Asia?" Look, if you want to trade Asia, yes, you can look for the same time elements to play out. However, the only issue that's present throughout Asia is that Asia sets the stage for the full daily delivery which is going to come. And therefore what you often see throughout Asia is that the delivery is not very clean in that sense—meaning you can see that it's just very tight ranges usually, you see the market just go back and forth, back and forth.

The moments that I am interested in are the moments which I'm mentioning to you now. That doesn't mean I trade London to New York afternoon session every single day. I determine what session I'm interested in the day in advance, maybe even the weekend in advance when I look at the economic calendar. However, in general, these are the sessions which I want you to focus on because this is where you're going to see the cleanest algorithmic price action. Why? Because this is when the amount of liquidity within the marketplace is the highest for the markets which we are interested in.

## Afternoon Session 90-Minute Cycles

Let's pay attention to the afternoon session 90-minute cycles. The afternoon session's respective 90-minute cycles begin at 11:30 AM and end at 4 PM.

What's very important to note is that the 11:30 AM to 1 PM 90-minute cycle is called the lunch cycle. Generally speaking, we do not look to trade this 90-minute cycle. There are days in which the lunch cycle will deliver a very volatile moment, and that is when there is a trending day and the market is in a rush to get somewhere. That is when you can anticipate that they are going to work through lunch, so to say.

However, on your average day-to-day day, you're likely going to see the market just engineering liquidity between 11:30 AM to 1 PM. What this lunch cycle does is that it sets the stage for the delivery which will take place between 1 to 2:30 PM.

So throughout PM2, which is the name of this second 90-minute cycle of the afternoon session, you will refer to the high and low of the lunch cycle. PM2 sets the stage for PM3, PM3 being from 2:30 PM to 4 PM. Throughout this 90-minute cycle, you refer to the high and low of the previous 90-minute cycle to gauge the order flow.

Again, each time cycle sets the stage for the next time cycle, and throughout the next 90-minute cycle, you refer to the high and low of the previous 90-minute cycle in order to gauge the order flow.

## Final Thoughts

Now with that being said, this lecture comes to an end. I hope that you found this insightful. I hope that you were able to gain a lot of insights on time cycles from it. If you did, be sure to go into your charts and investigate. And I really suggest you to claim this time cycles indicator because this time cycles indicator helps you out a lot with recognizing what the current 90-minute cycle is doing and what to anticipate from the next.

All in all, I believe that time cycles can get understood if you just put in the required time, because it's simply a game of repetition, repetition, repetition. Why? Because you will come to realize that every single day, there's a specific playbook which IPDA is following. Over time, your ability to recognize what the playbook for the day is will level up, because what will happen is that you're going to refer to past experiences in which you recognized the exact same delivery profile being in play on the same time cycles.

And once you understand time cycles, pay attention to delivery profiles. Delivery profiles are again also going to be discussed in great detail within this 2025 Models series.

Good luck with your studies. I look forward to catching up with you in the next episode.
