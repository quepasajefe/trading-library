# Risk Management - 2025 Model Series Lecture 13
**Date Processed:** [Current Date]  
**Lecture Type:** Capital Preservation and Growth  
**Focus:** Three Risk Management Strategies for Different Trading Contexts

## The Fundamental Principle: Risk Management Keeps You in the Game

"Technicals make you fall in love with the game. Risk management keeps you in the game." This opening statement encapsulates the entire philosophy - while technical analysis and entry strategies attract traders to markets, only proper risk management ensures survival and long-term success. The best technical system in the world fails without appropriate risk control.

This perspective shift is crucial. Many traders spend 90% of their time perfecting entries and 10% on risk management, when the ratio should be reversed. All the algorithmic signatures, time cycles, and price patterns taught throughout the series only work long-term when paired with disciplined risk management. Technical proficiency gets you into trades; risk management keeps you trading.

The lecture presents three distinct strategies, each suited for different contexts and experience levels. The common thread through all three: decrease risk during drawdown. This universal principle ensures equity curves remain smooth and deep drawdowns that destroy accounts psychologically and financially are avoided.

## Strategy 1: Regular Risk Management - The Foundation

### The Simple Framework

Regular risk management represents the most straightforward approach, suitable for most traders, especially those trading personal capital. The rules are clear:
- First trade: 1% risk (or your chosen base percentage)
- After a win: Maintain same risk level
- After a loss: Halve the risk to 0.5%
- Stay at reduced risk until drawdown recovered
- Once recovered, return to base risk

This simplicity is its strength. No complex calculations, no emotional decisions about sizing. Win = maintain, Loss = halve. The mechanical nature removes psychological pressure during drawdown periods when judgment is most impaired.

### The Smoothing Effect

The primary goal is maintaining a smooth equity curve by preventing deep drawdowns. When losses occur, immediate risk reduction ensures subsequent losses inflict minimal damage. This isn't about avoiding losses - they're inevitable. It's about ensuring losses don't compound into account-destroying drawdowns.

Consider the mathematics: losing 1% then 0.5% then 0.5% (if multiple losses occur) is far superior to losing 1%, 1%, 1%. The first scenario loses 2% total, the second loses 3%. This 33% difference in drawdown depth becomes crucial for psychological stability and mathematical recovery.

### The Recovery Mechanism

The system naturally encourages patience during recovery. By maintaining reduced risk until fully recovered, traders aren't tempted to "revenge trade" their way back to breakeven. The focus shifts from recovering money quickly to trading well consistently. Once proper trading resumes and drawdown recovers, full risk can be deployed again.

This creates a natural circuit breaker for poor trading periods. Bad streaks happen to everyone - this system ensures they don't become account-ending events. The trader who survives drawdowns eventually encounters favorable conditions again.

## Strategy 2: Prop Firm Risk Management - The Two-Phase Approach

### The Challenge Phase Philosophy

Prop firm challenges require a fundamentally different approach because the dynamics are inverted. In challenges, time is the enemy and there's no real money at risk - only the challenge fee. Zeussy recommends aggressive risk during challenges: 20% of total allowed drawdown per trade.

The mathematics are compelling. If maximum drawdown is $3,000 on a $100,000 challenge, risking $600 per trade (20% of $3,000) allows for five consecutive losses before failure. This aggressive approach acknowledges a truth about prop firms: they profit from failed challenges, so spending months in challenges generates no income while enriching the prop firm.

The goal is passing quickly or failing quickly to move on. Extended challenge periods waste opportunity cost that could be spent on funded trading or other ventures. This isn't recklessness but calculated aggression within a framework where the only real risk is the challenge fee.

### The Funded Account Reality

Once funded, the approach inverts completely to extreme conservatism: 10% of maximum drawdown as initial risk. On that same $100,000 account with $3,000 maximum drawdown, initial risk drops to just $300 per trade. This provides a 10-loss buffer before account termination.

The critical insight Zeussy provides: regular percentage-based risk management fails on prop accounts. Risking 1% of a $100,000 account ($1,000) when maximum drawdown is $3,000 means three losses terminate the account. This mathematical trap catches many traders who apply personal account strategies to prop firm accounts.

The funded phase follows similar reduction rules to regular management - halve risk after losses until recovered. But the base calculation uses maximum drawdown, not account equity, acknowledging the unique constraints of prop firm trading.

### The Prop Firm Critique

Zeussy's candid assessment that prop firms "are made for you to lose" and "profit from you failing" provides important context. The numerous rules and restrictions cultivate poor trading mindsets by adding artificial constraints that don't exist in real markets. His suggestion to approach them cautiously, if at all, comes from experience with their limitations.

## Strategy 3: Exponential Risk Management - The Accelerator

### The High-Wire Act

Exponential risk management isn't for beginners. It requires three prerequisites:
1. Expert knowledge of exactly what you're looking for in markets
2. Ability to emotionally detach from recent profits
3. Sufficient capital to handle larger position fluctuations

The strategy amplifies winning streaks dramatically:
- Trade 1: 1% risk, assume 5R winner = $5,000 profit
- Trade 2: Risk 50% of profits ($2,500), potential $12,500 profit
- Trade 3: Risk 25% of Trade 2 profits, continue geometric growth

The power is obvious - two or three consecutive wins can transform account equity. But this requires extraordinary psychological strength. Risking $2,500 after making $5,000 means accepting you might give back half your profits immediately. Most traders can't handle this emotionally.

### The Safety Mechanisms

Despite its aggressive nature, exponential management includes safety features:
- After any loss, return to 1% base risk
- During drawdowns, apply regular management rules (halve risk)
- Maximum streak limited to three trades before reset

These circuit breakers prevent catastrophic losses while maintaining upside potential. The system acknowledges that win streaks are temporary - even the best traders rarely exceed three consecutive wins. By forcing reset after trade three, profits get locked in before inevitable reversion.

### The Practical Application

For personal accounts with sufficient capital, exponential management can accelerate growth during favorable periods. For prop firms, it can help maximize profit splits during winning periods, though rules about consistency and daily loss limits might restrict implementation.

The key is recognizing this isn't an everyday strategy but a tool for specific situations. When market conditions align perfectly with your methodology and you're seeing everything clearly, exponential risk can capitalize on temporary edges. But it requires discipline to return to base risk when conditions normalize.

## The Universal Principle: Decrease Risk in Drawdown

### The Common Thread

All three strategies share one inviolable rule: reduce risk during drawdowns. This principle appears so consistently because it addresses both mathematical and psychological realities of trading.

Mathematically, reduced risk during drawdowns prevents the devastating geometry of losses. Losing 50% requires a 100% gain to recover. Losing 20% requires just 25% gain to recover. Keeping drawdowns shallow maintains mathematical viability.

Psychologically, smaller positions during difficult periods reduce stress and improve decision-making. Large losses impair judgment, leading to revenge trading and further losses. Smaller risk allows maintaining composure and trading mechanically until conditions improve.

### The Discipline Test

"You do not need to regain this lost equity right away" - this mindset shift separates professionals from amateurs. Amateurs frantically chase breakeven after losses. Professionals accept temporary drawdowns as business costs, focusing on process over results.

The risk reduction rule enforces this discipline mechanically. You can't revenge trade if your position size is halved. This forced patience often coincides with market conditions improving, as the same conditions causing your losses often affect other traders similarly, eventually creating opportunities.

## Implementation Considerations

### Starting Small: The Micro Contract Wisdom

Zeussy's advice to begin with micro contracts, regardless of account size, reflects deep understanding of psychological adaptation. Trading isn't just about having capital but handling the psychological weight of risk. Starting small allows building confidence and experience without devastating losses.

The progression from micros to minis should be gradual and comfort-based, not capital-based. Having money for larger positions doesn't mean having the psychological readiness. Each size increase requires adaptation time as the same percentage moves now represent larger dollar amounts.

### The Percentage Flexibility

While examples use 1% base risk, Zeussy emphasizes these percentages can be adjusted to individual comfort. A conservative trader might use 0.5% base risk, halving to 0.25% after losses. An aggressive trader might use 2%, halving to 1%.

The key isn't the specific percentages but maintaining the relationships - always halve after losses, always return to base after recovery. The mechanical nature of these rules is more important than the specific numbers.

### Choosing Your Strategy

Selection depends on multiple factors:
- **Regular Management**: For personal accounts, beginners, or those seeking simplicity
- **Prop Firm Management**: For those navigating challenge and funded account constraints
- **Exponential Management**: For experienced traders with capital and psychological readiness

Most traders should master regular management first, potentially exploring exponential management only after consistent profitability and sufficient psychological development.

## Critical Insights

### Risk Management as Edge Multiplier

The best technical edge becomes worthless with poor risk management, while mediocre technical skills can succeed with excellent risk management. This isn't suggesting technical skills don't matter, but highlighting that risk management multiplies whatever edge exists. Positive edge with good risk management compounds wealth; positive edge with poor risk management still leads to ruin.

### The Psychological Component

Each strategy addresses psychology differently:
- Regular management provides stability and simplicity
- Prop firm management acknowledges the unique psychological pressures of evaluation
- Exponential management requires exceptional psychological strength

Choosing the wrong strategy for your psychological profile guarantees failure regardless of technical proficiency. A psychologically fragile trader using exponential management will self-destruct even with perfect technical analysis.

### The Evolution Path

Most successful traders evolve through these strategies:
1. Begin with regular management for consistency
2. Potentially explore prop firms for additional capital
3. Eventually develop psychological strength for exponential approaches
4. Often return to modified regular management for long-term wealth preservation

This evolution isn't linear or mandatory. Many successful traders never leave regular management, finding its simplicity and reliability superior to complexity and stress.

## Questions for Further Investigation

Several aspects warrant additional exploration:

**How do these strategies interact with the trade management concepts from Lecture 12?** Does pyramiding affect risk calculations?

**What specific win rate and risk/reward ratios optimize each strategy?**

**How should strategies adjust for different market conditions or volatility regimes?**

**Can strategies be combined?** For example, regular management with occasional exponential periods?

**What psychological exercises develop the strength needed for exponential management?**

## The Complete Risk Framework

Risk management transforms theoretical knowledge into practical success. All the algorithmic signatures, time cycles, and entry patterns mean nothing without proper risk control. These three strategies provide frameworks for different situations, but all share the fundamental principle: protect capital during drawdowns to ensure survival for favorable periods.

The emphasis on decreasing risk during drawdowns rather than increasing it to "catch up" represents professional thinking. Markets provide endless opportunities, but only for traders who survive. These risk management strategies ensure survival while providing frameworks for growth, whether slow and steady through regular management or explosive through exponential approaches.

Success in trading isn't about maximizing returns but about maximizing risk-adjusted returns while surviving long enough for edge to manifest. These strategies provide the framework for that survival and eventual prosperity.
