**Focus:** Understanding Price Cycles and the Point A to Point B Framework

## The Fundamental Concept: Price Cycles

A price cycle represents the complete algorithmic price delivery process from Point A (inception) to Point B (terminus). This isn't simply a price move from one level to another - it's a systematic execution of algorithmic functions where every single bullish or bearish signature will manifest according to the current program in play. When Zeussy refers to a price cycle, he's describing the entire journey that price takes as high-frequency trading algorithms work through their programmed sequences.

The revolutionary aspect here is that these cycles aren't random market movements driven by retail sentiment or news events. They're predetermined algorithmic executions that follow specific protocols. Once you can identify where a cycle begins (Point A) and where it's programmed to terminate (Point B), you're essentially reading the roadmap that algorithms are following.

## The Point A to Point B Framework

### Understanding Point A - The Inception

Point A represents the inception of a new price swing, what Zeussy calls a Smart Money Reversal. In a buy program, this manifests as a swing low formation where the algorithms shift from distribution to accumulation. In a sell program, it appears as a swing high where the opposite transition occurs. 

What's critical to understand is that Point A isn't just any swing high or low - it's a specific algorithmic signature that marks the beginning of a new delivery sequence. The market doesn't randomly decide to reverse at Point A; the algorithms are programmed to initiate a new cycle at these specific points based on their coded functions.

### Understanding Point B - The Terminus

Point B is the predetermined destination where the current algorithmic cycle will complete. This is what Zeussy refers to as the "draw on liquidity" - a magnetic price point that algorithms are programmed to deliver price toward. The revolutionary insight here is that Point B exists and is definable BEFORE Point A even forms. This means the destination is already coded into the algorithm before the journey begins.

This challenges conventional trading wisdom where traders try to predict where price might go based on patterns or indicators. Instead, Zeussy is saying the terminus already exists in the algorithmic code - we just need to identify it. Once Point A confirms and the new cycle begins, the algorithms will systematically work price toward this predetermined Point B.

## How IPDA Executes Through Programs

### The Nature of Algorithmic Programs

IPDA (Interbank Price Delivery Algorithm) operates through what Zeussy calls "programs" - either buy programs or sell programs. These aren't suggestions or tendencies; they're systematic executions where algorithms fire in longs (buy program) or shorts (sell program) to move price from inception to terminus.

In a buy program, once Point A forms at a swing low, high-frequency trading algorithms begin accumulating positions and working price higher through specific levels. Each level that gets displaced above becomes support, creating a stair-step pattern of algorithmic footprints as price advances toward Point B. The algorithms aren't randomly buying - they're executing a specific sequence of accumulation, manipulation, and distribution that will complete at the predetermined terminus.

A sell program operates inversely, with algorithms firing in shorts from the Point A swing high, systematically working price lower through levels that then become resistance. The key insight is that these programs don't stop or reverse randomly - they continue until reaching their programmed destination at Point B.

### Working Through the Levels

One of the most important concepts Zeussy introduces is how algorithms "work through the levels." These aren't arbitrary support and resistance levels drawn by retail traders. They're specific price points that algorithms are programmed to reference and respect during their execution sequence.

When IPDA is in a buy program, it approaches each level systematically. The market will displace above a level, and that same level then functions as support. This isn't coincidence or market psychology - it's algorithmic execution. The algorithms are programmed to treat displaced levels as support in buy programs and resistance in sell programs. They're literally taking it "one level at a time" as they deliver price from Point A to Point B.

## The Concept of Price Distortion

Price distortion is one of the most practical concepts for actual trading application. It refers to temporary price movements beyond key levels that don't actually invalidate the current program. This typically manifests as wicks that penetrate above or below levels before price continues in the programmed direction.

Understanding price distortion is crucial because it explains why you can't simply place stops one tick above or below obvious levels. The algorithms are programmed to hunt these stops, creating temporary distortions that trap traders before continuing the intended delivery. When Zeussy sees a wick below a support level in a buy program that doesn't lead to further downside, he recognizes this as price distortion - a stop hunt that doesn't change the underlying algorithmic program.

This concept alone revolutionizes risk management. Instead of getting stopped out by every wick beyond a level, you learn to recognize which movements are mere distortions versus actual program changes. The algorithms create these distortions deliberately to trap retail traders who use obvious stop placement.

## The Equilibrium Principle

The equilibrium concept provides a mathematical framework for entry timing within a price cycle. Equilibrium represents the 50% point of the expected expansion from Point A to Point B. This isn't arbitrary - it's based on how algorithms balance positioning during a delivery cycle.

In a buy program, entering below equilibrium means you're participating in the discount portion of the cycle, where algorithms are still accumulating. The mathematical edge comes from entering where algorithms have favorable positioning relative to the ultimate terminus. Conversely, in a sell program, entering above equilibrium aligns you with algorithmic distribution.

This challenges the retail mentality of buying breakouts or selling breakdowns. Instead, you're entering at mathematically advantageous points within a predetermined cycle, aligned with algorithmic positioning rather than fighting it.

## Understanding Resistance in Liquidity Runs

### Low Resistance Liquidity Runs

These represent the ideal trading environments where algorithms execute their programs with minimal opposition. In these conditions, price moves swiftly from Point A toward Point B, often completing significant portions of the cycle in less than two hours. When you catch a low resistance run, entry leads to almost immediate expansion in your favor.

The key is that low resistance doesn't mean volatility - it means algorithmic efficiency. The algorithms encounter little opposing order flow and can execute their programmed delivery cleanly. These environments can be identified and anticipated, though the specific criteria will be developed in future lectures.

### High Resistance Liquidity Runs

In contrast, high resistance runs see algorithms working through significant opposing order flow. Price still moves from Point A to Point B, but the journey involves extensive consolidation, back-and-forth movement, and time consumption. You might sit in a position for hours before seeing meaningful progress toward the terminus.

While these environments still offer valid setups, Zeussy emphasizes focusing on low resistance conditions. The question isn't whether the program will complete - it will. The question is whether you want to endure the psychological challenge of sitting through extended consolidation versus capturing clean, efficient algorithmic delivery.

## The Fractal Nature of Price Cycles

One of the most profound insights is that price cycles exist across all timeframes simultaneously. A monthly price cycle from Point A to Point B contains weekly cycles, which contain daily cycles, which contain hourly cycles, down to sub-minute cycles. Each follows the same algorithmic principles, creating a fractal market structure.

This means a single large sell program from a major swing high to swing low contains multiple smaller buy and sell programs within it. Each retracement has its own Point A and Point B, its own inception and terminus. The highest probability setups occur when multiple timeframe cycles align - when the monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday cycles all point in the same direction.

This fractal understanding explains why the same algorithmic signatures appear on every timeframe. It's not that different algorithms operate on different timeframes - it's the same algorithmic logic executing across multiple scales simultaneously.

## The Universal Application Across Markets

Zeussy emphasizes that this isn't just an index futures phenomenon. The same algorithmic signatures appear in forex, commodities, and even crypto markets. This universality stems from his core premise: all liquid markets are "rigged" in the sense that they're controlled by algorithmic execution rather than random order flow.

The significance is that you're not learning a strategy specific to one market or timeframe. You're learning to read the underlying algorithmic language that drives all modern electronic markets. Whether it's NQ futures at 10 AM or EUR/USD during London open, the same programs execute through the same systematic level displacement from Point A to Point B.

## Critical Paradigm Shifts Required

### From Pattern Recognition to Sequence Recognition

Traditional technical analysis teaches pattern recognition - head and shoulders, triangles, flags. Zeussy's approach requires recognizing algorithmic sequences - the order of operations as programs execute. You're not looking for shapes on a chart; you're identifying where you are within an algorithmic execution sequence.

### From Prediction to Anticipation

Rather than trying to predict where price might go based on indicators or patterns, you're anticipating the completion of algorithmic programs already in motion. Once Point A confirms, Point B isn't a prediction - it's the predetermined destination that algorithms will deliver price toward.

### From Reaction to Participation

Retail traders react to price movement. This methodology positions you to participate in algorithmic delivery as it unfolds. You're not chasing moves or hoping for continuations; you're entering at mathematically optimal points within confirmed algorithmic cycles.

## What's Still Unknown - Questions for Investigation

While this lecture provides the foundational framework, several critical components require further development:

**How do we identify the specific price levels that algorithms will reference?** Zeussy mentions these levels exist but hasn't yet taught how to plot them on our charts.

**What confirms a Smart Money Reversal has occurred at Point A?** We know it's a swing formation, but what distinguishes an algorithmic reversal from a normal swing?

**How do we determine Point B in advance?** If the terminus is predetermined, what methodology identifies it before the cycle begins?

**What specific criteria identify low versus high resistance environments?** How do we know in advance whether we're facing efficient or choppy algorithmic delivery?

**How much price distortion is acceptable before a program invalidates?** Where's the line between a stop hunt and an actual program change?

**How do time cycles integrate with price cycles?** The next lecture promises to introduce time, but how do these dimensions converge?

## Practical Application Requirements

To properly investigate and validate these concepts, systematic chart study is required:

**Document complete price cycles from Point A to Point B across multiple markets and timeframes.** Don't just identify them - measure the time taken, the number of levels worked through, and the behavior at each level.

**Track every instance of price distortion that doesn't invalidate the program.** Build a visual library of what acceptable distortion looks like versus actual program changes.

**Compare entries at different points relative to equilibrium.** Validate whether below-equilibrium entries in buy programs consistently outperform above-equilibrium entries.

**Identify and catalogue low resistance versus high resistance deliveries.** What were the conditions? Time of day? News events? Build pattern recognition for efficiency.

**Map the fractal nature by identifying cycles within cycles.** Take a single daily cycle and identify every smaller cycle within it, noting alignment points.

## The Path Forward

This first lecture establishes the revolutionary lens through which all future concepts will be viewed. Every indicator, every pattern, every timing concept that follows will build upon this fundamental understanding: markets move in algorithmic cycles from Point A to Point B, working through levels systematically as programs execute their coded functions.

The challenge isn't whether these cycles exist - it's developing the skill to identify them in real-time and position yourself advantageously within them. This requires abandoning preconceived notions about why price moves and accepting that algorithmic execution, not human decision-making, drives modern market movement.
